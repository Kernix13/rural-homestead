# Livable Sheds/Cabins and Homesteading in a Rural Setting

This is mostly a markdown repo containing notes I need to find rural land in Kentucky or North Carolina and what it takes to get a Tiny Home/Livable Shed/Amish Prefab Cabin on the land.

Eventually, I want to turn it into a homestead and as off-grid as possible. The plan after getting my prefab cabin is to:

- Build out buildings as needed,
- Get all/most of my power from solar panels,
- Grow as much food as I can,
- Raise chickens,
- Fish, hunt, and trap as much meat as I can,
- Can, freeze, and smoke, etc. all my food
- Enjoy being out in nature everyday!

There are 4 sets of similarly named markdown files:

1. `land-[type]`: `-buy.md`, `-buy-info.md`, and `-search.md`:
   1. `land-search.md`: This was a worksheet of sorts to find websites that listed raw or undeveloped land (6 good ones) and some good articles at the end.
   2. `land-buy.md`: 6 articles about _How to buy land_
   3. `land-buy-info.md`: 7 articles on important tips and info on land in general and buying vacant land
1. `livable-sheds-[type]`: `-costs.md`, `-notes.md`, `-permits.md`, and `-steps.md` are categorized notes that were in the `Rural` files and may be duplicated in the `sheds-cabins` files
   1. [livable-sheds-costs.md](livable-sheds-costs.md): Costs associated with converting your shed/cabin into a livable space - foundation, land clearing, Plumber, Electrician, Carpenter, septic tank install, flooring, insualtion, drywall, Wood burning stove, solar setup, etc.
   2. [livable-sheds-notes.md](livable-sheds-notes.md): The most general of the 3 files and contains notes, info, guides and tips on livable sheds. For example, having a budget, planning the layout, permits & inspections, ventilation, water & sewer hookup, building codes, heating & cooling, zoning, the importance of 2x4's, etc.
   3. [livable-sheds-permits.md](livable-sheds-permits.md): Has information from various articles on permits, zoning, site plan, setbacks, inspections, fees, approval, codes & ordinances, paperwork, applications, etc.
   4. [livable-sheds-steps.md](livable-sheds-steps.md): the shortest of the 3 files and is a general overview of the process, although there are some unique notes in this file.
1. `Rural_[#]`: `Rural_1.md`, `Rural_2.md`, and `Rural_3.md` were my original working files
   1. [Rural_1.md](Rural_1.md): This file was the main file but I cut nearly everything out of it and now is just miscellaneous notes and articles. I'm keeping it for now. I have a link to IRA Exceptions one of which is $10K for a home purchase.
   2. [Rural_2.md](Rural_2.md): These are notes from videos by Ken Wheeler. There are 4 sections: 1) Land, 2) Solar, 3) Power, 4) Survival. The power section is not so good, and I have a lot of bushcraft/survival gear but I love talking gear. There are some good notes in that section. For the Land and Solar sections I include a list titled _Important topics/phrases_ at the top of the section. Definitely check those two out!
   3. [Rural_3.md](Rural_3.md): The bulk of this is the best notes from Ken's Land videos. At the bottom are sections on Google Earth and notes from a few articles.
1. `State-[name]`: Pertinent notes for Kentucky and North Carolina in their respective files.
   1. [State-kentucky1.md](State-kentucky1.md): This has links to Kentucky county and city web pages to look into permits and if they allow tiny homes. I also have links to campgrounds which I may need until I find and buy land.
   1. [State-north-carolina.md](State-north-carolina.md): I was originally looking at North Carolina but have since focused solely on Kentucky. There is not a lot in this file.

Other important markdown files:

1. [land-search.md](land-search.md): I originally just searched for "_raw land for sale in kentucky_" which yieled LandSearch.com, LandAndFarm.com and LandWatch.com. After speaking with a realtor who was a friend of a friend of mine, I found 4 more websites to find raw/undeveloped land.
   1. This is the main file to use for searching. Do I have the best sites? How else to find land?
   2. I may need another file called `Results.md` to track every listing I'm interested in, though I will add it to `.gitignore`.
2. [Realtor-notes.md](Realtor-notes.md): These are notes from the agent.
3. [sheds-cabins1.md](sheds-cabins1.md): There is some unique info in here and some duplicate info. Most of the info that was in here is now in the `livable-sheds` files. This file can probably be skipped.
4. `kentucky.html` and `style.css`: a quick HTML file used to paste into a CodePen pen for the agent who helped me - very little styling - IGNORE
5. `data.js`: this was a quick JavaScript file to output onto the page terms and jargon that I needed to learn - IGNORE

From the owner:

> _Hello, the property is available for rent and move-in ASAP, I am the owner of the property located at 114 Whitehurst St, Elizabeth City, NC which has just been recently renovated. I wanted to sell it out but due to some facts about the realtor I was working with before I decided not to sell it again, the agents are not truthful about handling things and I am looking to handle things myself now the best way I can . Am looking for someone that will take care of the property as if it was their own, someone that will be very neat, take good care of the property for me and make payment of rent with no delay. Pets are allowed as long as they are not destructive._

> _The rent is **`$970`** while the security deposit is $800 . The house is ready to move in.. Utilities are included in the Rent AND LEASE IS 6 MONTHS TO A YEAR WITH OPTION OF LEASE TO OWN. The house is for rent now but would be really interested in a lease to own in the future._
