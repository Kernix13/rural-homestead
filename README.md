# Livable Sheds/Cabins and Homesteading in a Rural Setting

This is mostly a markdown repo containing notes I need to find rural land in Kentucky or North Carolina and what it takes to get a Tiny Home/Livable Shed/Amish Prefab Cabin on the land.

Eventually, I want to turn it into a homestead and as off-grid as possible. The plan after getting my prefab cabin is to:

- Build out buildings as needed,
- Get all/most of my power from solar panels,
- Grow as much food as I can,
- Raise chickens,
- Fish, hunt, and trap as much meat as I can,
- Can, freeze, and smoke, etc. all my food
- Enjoy being out in nature everyday!

There are 4 sets of similarly named markdown files:

1. `land-[type]`: `-buy.md`, `-buy-info.md`, and `-search.md`:
   1. `land-search.md`: This was a worksheet of sorts to find websites that listed raw or undeveloped land (6 good ones) and some good articles at the end.
   2. `land-buy.md`: 6 articles about _How to buy land_
   3. `land-buy-info.md`: 7 articles on important tips and info on land in general and buying vacant land
1. `livable-sheds-[type]`: `-costs.md`, `-notes.md`, `-permits.md`, and `-steps.md` are categorized notes that were in the `Rural` files and may be duplicated in the `sheds-cabins` files
   1. [livable-sheds-costs.md](livable-sheds-costs.md): Costs associated with converting your shed/cabin into a livable space - foundation, land clearing, Plumber, Electrician, Carpenter, septic tank install, flooring, insualtion, drywall, Wood burning stove, solar setup, etc.
   2. [livable-sheds-notes.md](livable-sheds-notes.md): The most general of the 3 files and contains notes, info, guides and tips on livable sheds. For example, having a budget, planning the layout, permits & inspections, ventilation, water & sewer hookup, building codes, heating & cooling, zoning, the importance of 2x4's, etc.
   3. [livable-sheds-permits.md](livable-sheds-permits.md): Has information from various articles on permits, zoning, site plan, setbacks, inspections, fees, approval, codes & ordinances, paperwork, applications, etc.
   4. [livable-sheds-steps.md](livable-sheds-steps.md): the shortest of the 3 files and is a general overview of the process, although there are some unique notes in this file.
1. `Rural_[#]`: `Rural_1.md`, `Rural_2.md`, and `Rural_3.md` were my original working files
   1. [Rural_1.md](Rural_1.md): This file was the main file but I cut nearly everything out of it and now is just miscellaneous notes and articles. I'm keeping it for now. I have a link to IRA Exceptions one of which is $10K for a home purchase.
   2. [Rural_2.md](Rural_2.md): These are notes from videos by Ken Wheeler. There are 4 sections: 1) Land, 2) Solar, 3) Power, 4) Survival. The power section is not so good, and I have a lot of bushcraft/survival gear but I love talking gear. There are some good notes in that section. For the Land and Solar sections I include a list titled _Important topics/phrases_ at the top of the section. Definitely check those two out!
   3. [Rural_3.md](Rural_3.md): The bulk of this is the best notes from Ken's Land videos. At the bottom are sections on Google Earth and notes from a few articles.
1. `State-[name]`: Pertinent notes for Kentucky and North Carolina in their respective files.
   1. [State-kentucky1.md](State-kentucky1.md): This has links to Kentucky county and city web pages to look into permits and if they allow tiny homes. I also have links to campgrounds which I may need until I find and buy land.
   1. [State-north-carolina.md](State-north-carolina.md): I was originally looking at North Carolina but have since focused solely on Kentucky. There is not a lot in this file.

Other important markdown files:

1. [land-search.md](land-search.md): I originally just searched for "_raw land for sale in kentucky_" which yieled LandSearch.com, LandAndFarm.com and LandWatch.com. After speaking with a realtor who was a friend of a friend of mine, I found 4 more websites to find raw/undeveloped land.
   1. This is the main file to use for searching. Do I have the best sites? How else to find land?
   2. I may need another file called `Results.md` to track every listing I'm interested in, though I will add it to `.gitignore`.
2. [Realtor-notes.md](Realtor-notes.md): These are notes from the agent.
3. [sheds-cabins1.md](sheds-cabins1.md): There is some unique info in here and some duplicate info. Most of the info that was in here is now in the `livable-sheds` files. This file can probably be skipped.
4. `kentucky.html` and `style.css`: a quick HTML file used to paste into a CodePen pen for the agent who helped me - very little styling - IGNORE
5. `data.js`: this was a quick JavaScript file to output onto the page terms and jargon that I needed to learn - IGNORE
