# Livable Sheds/Cabins and Homesteading in a Rural Setting

This is mostly a markdown repo containing notes I need to find rural land in Kentucky or North Carolina and what it takes to get a Tiny Home/Livable Shed/Amish Prefab Cabin on the land.

Eventually, I want to turn it into a homestead and as off-grid as possible. The plan after getting my prefab cabin is to:

- Build out buildings as needed,
- Get all/most of my power from solar panels,
- Grow as much food as I can,
- Raise chickens,
- Fish, hunt, and trap as much meat as I can,
- Can, freeze, and smoke, etc. all my food
- Enjoy being out in nature everyday!

There are 3 sets of markdown files:

1. `livable-sheds-[type]`: `-costs.md`, `-notes.md`, `-permits.md`, and `-steps.md` are categorized notes that were in the `Rural` files and may be duplicated in the `sheds-cabins` files
   1. [livable-sheds-costs.md](livable-sheds-costs.md): Costs associated with converting your shed/cabin into a livable space - foundation, land clearing, Plumber, Electrician, Carpenter, septic tank install, flooring, insualtion, drywall, Wood burning stove, solar setup, etc.
   2. [livable-sheds-notes.md](livable-sheds-notes.md): The most general of the 3 files and contains notes, info, guides and tips on livable sheds. For example, having a budget, planning the layout, permits & inspections, ventilation, water & sewer hookup, building codes, heating & colling, zoning, the importance of 2x4's, etc.
   3. [livable-sheds-permits.md](livable-sheds-permits.md): Has information from various articles on permits, zoning, site plan, setbacks, inspections, fees, approval, codes & ordinances, paperwork, applications, etc.
   4. [livable-sheds-steps.md](livable-sheds-steps.md): the shortest of the 3 files and is a general overview of the process, although there are some unique notes in this file.
2. `Rural_[#]`: `Rural_1.md`, `Rural_2.md`, and `Rural_3.md` were my original working files
   1. [Rural_1.md](Rural_1.md): This file was the main file but I cut nearly everything out of it and now is just miscellaneous notes and articles. I'm keeping it for now. I have a link to IRA Exceptions one of which is $10K for a home purchase.
   2. [Rural_2.md](Rural_2.md): These are notes from videos by Ken Wheeler. There are 4 sections: 1) Land, 2) Solar, 3) Power, 4) Survival. The power section is not so good, and I have a lot of bushcraft/survival gear but I love talking gear. There are some good notes in that section. For the Land and Solar sections I include a list titled _Important topics/phrases_ at the top of the section. Definitely check that out!
   3. [Rural_3.md](Rural_3.md): The bulk of this is the best notes from Ken's Land videos. At the bottom are sections on Google Earth and notes from a few articles.
3. `State-[name]`: Pertinent notes for Kentucky and North Carolina in their respective files.
   1. `State-kentucky1.md`: This has links to county and city permits web pages!!!
   1. `State-north-carolina.md`: I was originally looking at North Carolina but have since focused solely on Kentucky.

Other important markdown files:

1. `land-search.md`: This has my first searches at the bottom of the file. Then after speaking with a realtor who was a friend of a friend of mine, I found more websites for where to find raw/undeveloped land.
   1. This is the main file to use for searching. Do I have the best sites? How else to find land?
   2. I may need another file called `Results.md` to track every listing I'm interested in, though I will add it to `.gitignore`. I will add some notes though into the kentucky file.
2. `Realtor-notes.md`: These are notes from a friend of a friend who is an agent.
3. `sheds-cabins1.md`: There is some unique info in here and some duplicate info. Most of the info that was in here is now in the `livable-sheds` files
4. `kentucky.html` and `style.css`: a quick HTML file used to paste into a CodePen pen for the agent who helped me - very little styling.
