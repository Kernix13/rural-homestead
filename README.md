# Livable Sheds/Cabins and Homesteading in a Rural Setting

This is mostly a markdown repo containing notes I need to find rural land in Kentucky or North Carolina and what it takes to get a Tiny Home/Livable Shed/Amish Prefab Cabin on the land.

Eventually, I want to turn it into a homestead and as off-grid as possible. The plan is to get all my power from solar, grow as much food as I can, fish, hunt, and trap as much meat as I can eat, freeze, and smoke, etc.

There are 3 sets of markdown files:

1. `livable-sheds-[type]`: `-notes.md`, `-permits.md`, and `-steps.md` are categorized notes that were in the `Rural` files and may be duplicated in the `sheds-cabins` files
   1. `livable-sheds-notes.md`: the most general of the 3 files and contains Notes, Info, Guides and Tips on livable sheds
   2. `livable-sheds-permits.md`: Has information from various articles on permits, zoning, and licensing
   3. `livable-sheds-steps.md`: the shortest of the 3 files and is a general overview of the process
   4. `livable-sheds-costs.md`: Costs associated with converting your shed/cabin into a livable space
2. `Rural_[#]`: `Rural_1.md`, `Rural_2.md`, and `Rural_3.md` were my original working files
   1. `Rural_1.md`: This file was the main file but I cut nearly everything out of it and now is just miscellaneous notes. I'm keeping it for now.
   2. `Rural_2.md`: These are notes from videos by Ken Wheeler. There are43 sections: 1) Land, 2) Solar, 3) Power, 4) Survival
   3. `Rural_3.md`: The bulk of this is the best notes from Ken's Land videos. At the bottom are sections on Google Earth and articles I need to read.
3. `State-[name]`: Pertinent notwes for Kentucky and North Carolina in their respective files.
   1. `State-kentucky1.md`: This has links to county and city permits web pages!!!
   1. `State-north-carolina.md`: I was originally looking at North Carolina but have since focused solely on Kentucky.

Other important markdown files:

1. `land-search.md`: This has my first searches at the bottom of the file. Then after speaking with a realtor who was a friend of a friend of mine, I found more websites for where to find raw/undeveloped land.
2. `Realtor-notes.md`: These are notes from a friend of a friend who is an agent.
3. `sheds-cabins1.md`: There is some unique info in here and some duplicate info. Most of the info that is in here, or was in here, is in the `livable-sheds` files
4. `kentucky.html` and `style.css`: a quick HTML file used to paste into a CodePen pen for the agent who helped me - very little styling.
