# Notes from Alexa

## Thanks Alexa!

### 1. Websites: YOU NEED CREDIBLE SITES

- Sign up for some sites, no more than 3 or start with or only 1
- Search for top 5 websites - general websites, good UI/UX
- The "real" ones have membership costs and offers, membership types
- Start with the lower cost sites
- A lot of them will show the same listings

### 2. Ownership

- Could be a person or a company or a bank or a county - don't worry about that in the beginning
- Eventually, you will be able to find out who the owner is
- Banks - auctions - will take you to another site for the auction
- Owners - can range from bad deal to a great deal - owners often overprice the land

### 3. Listing

- Who is listing the land? Bank, agent, owner, county, ...

### 4. Zoning

- Have the agent double-check the zoning for you
- See what is on the market - how far away is she/he from those lands
- Ask them: "If it is not too far, …"
- (1) on market, (2) zoning, (3) video of land

### 5. Making An Offer

- Regular market -> agent gets 2-3%
- Owner -> How do they want the offer? You may need to hire an attorney. Do they want the offer through an attorney or agent
- Will they pay the agent the 2% agent fee? If not will they split it and pay 1%?

### TITLE SEARCH

- Owner pays or buyer? Attorneys (flat fee) don't negotiate, agents will

### CLOSING

- It should be by a title company
- Sales transactions/closing to the company involvement (agent or attorney - HUH?

### WALKING THE LAND

- You never know how many offers the listing got
- If the offer is accepted, and <em><ins>under contract</ins></em>, …"I always want to be under review"?
- <em><ins>For my preferred time</ins></em> - in order to be able to opt out of contract
- <em><ins>Earnest Money</ins></em>
- If offer is accepted the seller expects to pay earnest money (Seller pays or buyer pays?)
- Earnest Money is protection against them keeping the money

### UNDER REVIEW

- attorney: "review for 2 business days …" - in contract
- You get the earnest money back

### Miscellaneous

- "gated community": What does that mean? Do they have as much say as in a Home Owners Association?
- "Agricultural Land": Does that type only allow farming or can I place a tiny home on the agricultural land?

## Alexa - WordPress website build

WordPress is the best option for small businesses. I own 3 WordPress websites, one of which uses the classic theme that I built.

- The quickest and easiest theme would be a classic theme with a child theme
- Next would be a block theme like `Frost`, `Olly` or `Twentytwentyfour`
- Next would be a custom classic theme which would take much more time
- Lastly would be a custom block theme. This would be my preferred theme, however, I never finished learning how to build a block theme. Once I settle into my new home, this is exactly what I will do.

> "_best free wordpress theme for real estate website_" - make sure they are block themes or just go with _Frost_
