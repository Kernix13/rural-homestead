### 4. ‚ô¶Ô∏è RAW LAND TIPS & Expert TRICKS ü§î - 1 year ago

> TIPS:

- Use Google Earth to zoom around & find different _access points_
- Check property taxes / tax base -
- Has there been a _professional survey_ done? A survey is worth its weight in gold
  - Check your local _PVA office_ to see what thye say the acreage is b\c it's usually not accurate, off by no more than 5-8%
  - Not professionally surveyed keeps the fools away
- NEIGHBORS: DON'T TALK TO THEM UNTIL YOU OWN THE LAND! They don't know the land behind them is for sale - if they find out, they will buy it - keep that in mind if you are asked what you are doing
- Does it have water - water is very important - sping is the best, next creek
- Trees - are they desirable or small - selective haversting can make the land free
- Always look for land that has been inherited because the sellers don't know what's on it
- A fence is gold - it is almost a professional survey
- Look to see if it has great access - meaning roads and you can subdivide it and sell parts off
- Make some of it a campground kickstarter to make the land pay for itself
- Hilly unsurveyed land cab be pure gold - he has land in `Pikeville` which has old growth trees on it
- How good is the internet and _cell phone access_? that is REALLY important
- How close to the nearest town for food
- Check out the zoning to see what you can and can't do with the land
- Look out for pissy neighbors
- **Hound realtors to death about picking your land out before it gets listed** - once it gets listed, all sorts of people are trying to buy it
  - Tell them you aren't going to finance, you have cash - "_let me know and I will make it worth your while_" - offer them bonuses for finding you the land
- Don't buy land-locked land, land where you have to go thru someone elses land to get to the land - that is a huge issue - but if you do make sure the _easement_ is written into the deed
- Put on your cabin, put an acre or two around with a road to get to it and that is all you need - raw land takes care of itself
- Make sure it is not in a flood plane
- Are utilities close
- Look into _mineral rights_ - you bought the land but may not own what is below the land - like in Eastern Kentucky almost no one has mineral rights
- Barns - a barn isn't worth anything unless it is well built and has a concrete foundation - it really doesn't add value
- Buy cheap land next to ritzy neighborhoods for an investment
- **Always get a title search**, a title search is insured - they are about $500
  - TITLE SEARCH: _A property title search examines public records to confirm a property's rightful, legal owner_
- Buy land that has a farming exemption
- Most important before you buy it - inspect it - walk over all of it
- OFFER CASH - realtors work on numbers per year
- When you buy the land you have to be increadibly proactive on the property taxes the first year because the government is really slow - they will send the property taxes to the previous owner - the first year you have to be proactive and call the shefiffs dept and tell them you are the new owner - find out when they mail the property taxes - tell them to send you the bill - MAKE SURE THEY SEND YOU THE BILL

### 5. üò± A Most INCREDIBLE LAND deal üòéüëçüå≥

- His buddy bought 50 acres at $248/acre!
- Pikeville in Pike county

### 6. üò® A SECRET of BUYING RAW LAND ü§ó

- Cut/thin the most desirable trees which pays for the land - the land ends up being free - black walnut, oak, hickory, depends on the year

### 7. üòô Cheap Kentucky Land ü§©

### 8. ü§î Tricks & Tips: BUYING RAW LAND ü§î

What to look for when buying land

- Is it bottom land - is it in a flood zone
- Do you have the correct ground strata for a septic system
- Is their water on it or running thru it - is it clean water
- Is their an easement - is the easement written into the deed
  - `EASEMENT`: a limited right to use the property of another. Common easements include driveways, private roads, and utility rights-of-way for electric, water, or communication lines. Most easements are contained in deeds; some can arise simply due to the passage of time
  - Is it land locked
- YOU NEED TO READ THE DEED
- Are there any redeeming features on the land: caves, how deep is the top soil
- You need a title search - lawyers or yourself - are there any liens on the property
- IMPORTANT - now he is saying to talk to the neighbors - you must do it - can be very revealing
- How accessible to services, food, the road - how far to the gracery store
- The trees: what kind, how big, any indication people are stealing the trees on it
- Does the land have any restrictions on it: for building, septic systems, where you can build,
- Is there game on the land for hunting

### 9. üßê 4 LAND BUYING TIPS I KNOW WORK

- `#1` Walk the land - look at it
- `#2` Knock on neighbors doors, introduce yourself, maybe offer a $10 bill - ask them what they know - realtors don't care about your needs as much as you do, they care about their commission and moving onto the next listing
- `#3` The land itself: make sure you have mineral rights - make sure it is not in a flood plane - no issues with the land
- `#4` Don't offer close to what they are asking for it - "_This is my first offer, come back with a counter offer_" - business is business - list off the problems

### 10. üòá Buying RAW LAND: Tips & Tricks üòá

Raw Land = no structures

- IMPORTANT: after looking at the land talk to all the neighbors though sometimes it is a risk
- FREE INFO: Go down to the `PVA` office & the `Delinquent Tax Office` & the `Deed Room` which is part of a `Title Search`
  - _Sheriff's ofice_ for something ?!?
- make an offer but before the _closing_ do the _Title search_ - if it comes back clear...
- Deed - looks for changes in the deed -
- Learn how to use a GPS - mark key points in lat/long -
- Ways around a pro survey: coal country has coal company surveys and so are accurate
- TREES: _selective timbering_

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

### 11. ü§© Raw Land Buying Secrets üò± Genuinely undeniable

- Land that is _not_ sold instantly is because there is not a professional survey - **but if it is cheap, so what**
- `#1` So no professioanl survey = cheap, **_if it is not cheap don't buy it_** - if the land is dirt cheap is does NOT need to have a pro survey
- `#2` Property tax notice is usually Oct or Nov - **be proactive** - it will go to the prior owner - creeps "buy the bill" >
- `#3` Information is gold - go to the deed ofc, the pvs, sheriffs dept, property taxes, find if there are liens on it, title search ($500), find out where the boundaries are, have pictures, features of the land, etc

### 1. üòò DIY Large SOLAR PANEL STAND üòÑüëç

- Kickstand for large panels - `320 watt 24 volt Renogy` panel
- Getting 40 `volts` to the `volt meter` in full sun
- Renogy _Lithium Iron Phosphate battery_ - VERY expensive
- Mostly he has _Deep Cycle Lead Acid (flooded) marine batteries_, Nautilus Exide, 115 amp hr, _deep discharge_
- `Adventurer` _charge controller_, 30 amp
- He is using pvc pipe, pvc t-joints, metal hose clamps to attach to the panel
- Everything is glued except where the pipe can hinge
- He is using a "limiter" (rope?) to set the max extension of the pvc legs

> Never hook your charge controller or solar panel without hooking the battery to the charge controller first or it will wrech the controller

### 2. ü•≥üåû 200W OFF-GRID Portable Solar SOLUTION üå∫

- People steal solar panels
- 200 watt briefcase, Renogy briefcase ... - mono-crystalline
- 4 panels @ 50 watts each = 200 watts
- Renogy briefcase is nicer than Boulders'
- It's $365 - the latches are horrible but the nicest case in the industry
- He has a `Voyager` charge controller
- Upgrade: the alligator clips that comes with it has a 10 or 15 amp fuse since it is a 200 watt panel
  - People reported of burning their fuses out
  - Have spare fuses - he has them attached with velcro on the back
  - He has 20 or 25 amp fuse
- Think it comes with hook and loop - it gets the cabling out of the way, so it does not get pinched when you close the briefcase
- 200 watt `Goal Zero Nomad` (very fragile) is another portable option
- 100 watt panel is not enough under ideal conditions - 1.5 days to chage the battery with a 12-14 run time
- He also has _golf cart battteries_
- You won't run a fridge off of this - tv, laptop and lights you can, maybe a low energy fridge
- $365 for the solar panel, $20 in cabling, $130/battery ~ $550
  - But you need more than one battery in parallel or in series
- The unit comes with a charge controller - case weighs ~ 35lbs

> He only needs 200 watts for his cabin

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

### 3. ü§©üåû My portable SOLAR POWER rig I built ‚òÄÔ∏è

- Small 20 amp charge controller _prismatic lithium cells_,
- He soldered on the battery cables to the controller wires and also to connectors for the solar panels with Renogy connectors

> you always need charge controllers and maybe inverters

### 5. ü•≥ Solar Batteries & POWER Redundancy Solutions. POWER QUEENüî•ü§©

- What to use to connect the charge controller to the _battery bank_
  - Buy jumper cables, split them down the middle, strip off the ends, twist the ends tight and put them in the _controller terminals_
  - That is for the solar panels to converter
  - But for the batteries to the controller, only use pure copper cables
  - 3:38?
  - Battery interconnect cables
- He mentioned Lithium Iron Phosphate batteries (li-fopo's, not lithium iron batteries) - don't have to worry about leaving hooked up to your charge controller & solar panel system and having a fire break out
- Look into mini _Igloo refrigerators_ and _ice making machines_

> Check the dates - he seems to like power queen more than renogy

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

### 6. üåûüå≥ Parallel SOLAR hookup 740Ah & 960W ü§ì

> Voltaic.com website > touch led lights, dimmable - low power usage

- 2000 watt Renogy inverter

Parallel battery setup

- Connect positive to positive to positive ...
- Connect negative to negative to negative ...
- The `negative` cable from the power inverter to the `last`/first `negative` of the battery setup
- The `positive` cable from the power inverter to the last/`first` `positive` of the battery setup
- Also positive and negative from the charge controller to the positive/first of the batteries and negative/last of the batteries respectively
  - You need beefy cables from the charge controller
  - Don't use copper clad cca - get solid copper
- You do need beefy solid copper cables from the inverter to the batteries and also for joining the batteries in parallel
- Each battery has a regular screw post and a regular lug which is important because you run out of space for the last/first positive/negative because each of those two has a parallel connection, inverter connection, and a converter connection
- He uses aligator clapms for the controller to the battery connection on the lug nuts
- 740 hrs of lead acid - he has a fridge,
- He has a redundant charge controller and inverter
- He has three 320 watt solar panels on his pvc setup

> $900 for 4 trees to be cut down which was dangerous for the cabin + blocking the sun

> NEVER, EVER HOOK UP SOLAR TO THE CHARGE CONTROLLER FIRST - ALWAYS HOOK UP THE BATTERIES FIRST TO THE CONTROLLER THEN HOOK UP THE SOLAR - and when breaking down disconnect solar panels from controller first

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

### 7. üåûü§© LARGE SOLAR PANEL Mobile Stand DIY üòö

- The stand needs weights for wind
- They should be mounted on the roof but there are disadvantages:
  - Cleaning, access, need 2-3 people to help you mount it, holes in the roof that you need to caulk, ...
- The only negative to mounting on the ground (not in the dirt, elevated) is theft
- Cordage - search on ebay for "cordage" - sold in mm - he has 4mm 1000 lbs
- Need 4 hose clamps - 3/4" PVC, 8 T-Joints, connector add the clamp before it, PVC glue,
- 320 watt solar panel - 400 & 500 watt are too big - $1/watt

### 8. üòç SOLAR POWER SYSTEM üòò 200W & OKMO power station

- Okmo 1000 watt `power station` - better than Jackery - it has 18 more amp hrs for $250 less than 1000 watt okmo (?)
- Anderson power pull (pole?) y-connector to hook up 2 solar panels
- Ideal conditions - 4 factors: temperature, incidence of the light, intensity of the light, ... couple more that affect recharge time
- Okmo 1000 has a Lithium iron battery - 9-12 hrs for complete recharge
- Don't drain any lithium iron battery to zero - they like to sit around 50-60% - but you want it charged to 100 for an emergency
- Need solar panels, charge controller, power inverter
- The battery is inside the Okmo 1000, but also the charge controller is built in
  - Solar panel to charge controller > battery to power inverter
- This video is confusing

> You always need a charge controller with solar panels
> You basically have 4 things in a solar system setup: 1. solar panels, 2. charge controller, 3. power inverter (preferably pure sinewave), 4. battery

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

### 9. üåû DIY SOLAR BRIEFCASE Setup! üòáüëç RENOGY 200W or 100W Solar Briefcase

- 200 watt Renogy Eclipse mono-crystalline solar briefcase:
- Applicable to all solar briefcases:

  - No videos show you how to quicky & accurately hookup your briefcase
  - Make sure you have a 20 watt fuse, not 10
  - Have spare fuses because they are the weak link
  - Have a charge controller
  - Position every thing so things on opposite sides don't pancake preventing the unit from closing
  - Cabling extensions
  - NOTE: he has the charge controller on hooks so he can pull it out to see...
  - Hook the charge controller to the battery first, then to the solar panel, you can burn out your charge controller fast with bright sun
  - Once you are done charging UN-HOOK your solar from the controller
  - Charge controller cables
  - Leads from the solar panels
  - 1st solar panel hooks to the black thing (switch board connector) on the other one then 2nd solar panel to the MC44 connectors
  - Final step hook the MC4 connectors together AFTER the controller-battery connection
  - Lots of velcro - additional cable in case it rains, alligator clip leads
  - You also need a fuse from the controller to the battery, 15 amp fuse
  - _He soldered the cables from the battery into the controller_!?!

  > Renogy Lithium Iron Phosphate battery, $800, less heave than lead-acid
