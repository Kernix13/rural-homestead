### 4. ♦️ RAW LAND TIPS & Expert TRICKS 🤔 - 1 year ago

> TIPS:

- Use Google Earth to zoom around & find different _access points_
- Check property taxes / tax base -
- Has there been a _professional survey_ done? A survey is worth its weight in gold
  - Check your local _PVA office_ to see what thye say the acreage is b\c it's usually not accurate, off by no more than 5-8%
  - Not professionally surveyed keeps the fools away
- NEIGHBORS: DON'T TALK TO THEM UNTIL YOU OWN THE LAND! They don't know the land behind them is for sale - if they find out, they will buy it - keep that in mind if you are asked what you are doing
- Does it have water - water is very important - sping is the best, next creek
- Trees - are they desirable or small - selective haversting can make the land free
- Always look for land that has been inherited because the sellers don't know what's on it
- A fence is gold - it is almost a professional survey
- Look to see if it has great access - meaning roads and you can subdivide it and sell parts off
- Make some of it a campground kickstarter to make the land pay for itself
- Hilly unsurveyed land cab be pure gold - he has land in `Pikeville` which has old growth trees on it
- How good is the internet and _cell phone access_? that is REALLY important
- How close to the nearest town for food
- Check out the zoning to see what you can and can't do with the land
- Look out for pissy neighbors
- **Hound realtors to death about picking your land out before it gets listed** - once it gets listed, all sorts of people are trying to buy it
  - Tell them you aren't going to finance, you have cash - "_let me know and I will make it worth your while_" - offer them bonuses for finding you the land
- Don't buy land-locked land, land where you have to go thru someone elses land to get to the land - that is a huge issue - but if you do make sure the _easement_ is written into the deed
- Put on your cabin, put an acre or two around with a road to get to it and that is all you need - raw land takes care of itself
- Make sure it is not in a flood plane
- Are utilities close
- Look into _mineral rights_ - you bought the land but may not own what is below the land - like in Eastern Kentucky almost no one has mineral rights
- Barns - a barn isn't worth anything unless it is well built and has a concrete foundation - it really doesn't add value
- Buy cheap land next to ritzy neighborhoods for an investment
- **Always get a title search**, a title search is insured - they are about $500
  - TITLE SEARCH: _A property title search examines public records to confirm a property's rightful, legal owner_
- Buy land that has a farming exemption
- Most important before you buy it - inspect it - walk over all of it
- OFFER CASH - realtors work on numbers per year
- When you buy the land you have to be increadibly proactive on the property taxes the first year because the government is really slow - they will send the property taxes to the previous owner - the first year you have to be proactive and call the shefiffs dept and tell them you are the new owner - find out when they mail the property taxes - tell them to send you the bill - MAKE SURE THEY SEND YOU THE BILL

### 5. 😱 A Most INCREDIBLE LAND deal 😎👍🌳

- His buddy bought 50 acres at $248/acre!
- Pikeville in Pike county

### 6. 😨 A SECRET of BUYING RAW LAND 🤗

- Cut/thin the most desirable trees which pays for the land - the land ends up being free - black walnut, oak, hickory, depends on the year

### 7. 😙 Cheap Kentucky Land 🤩

- Location: are your neighbors people you wouldn't want to live next to
- Is there water, what sort of water
- Has the good trees been harvested
- Are there structures on it
- Are there restrictions on what you can do with the land
- Has it been professionally surveyed (never off by more than 8%)
- Coal company surveys don't count as "professional" but theirs are pretty close to the actual
- He mentioned Pikeville again

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

### 8. 🤔 Tricks & Tips: BUYING RAW LAND 🤔

What to look for when buying land

- Is it bottom land - is it in a flood zone
- Do you have the correct ground strata for a septic system
- Is their water on it or running thru it - is it clean water
- Is their an easement - is the easement written into the deed
  - `EASEMENT`: a limited right to use the property of another. Common easements include driveways, private roads, and utility rights-of-way for electric, water, or communication lines. Most easements are contained in deeds; some can arise simply due to the passage of time
  - Is it land locked
- YOU NEED TO READ THE DEED
- Are there any redeeming features on the land: caves, how deep is the top soil
- You need a title search - lawyers or yourself - are there any liens on the property
- IMPORTANT - now he is saying to talk to the neighbors - you must do it - can be very revealing
- How accessible to services, food, the road - how far to the gracery store
- The trees: what kind, how big, any indication people are stealing the trees on it
- Does the land have any restrictions on it: for building, septic systems, where you can build,
- Is there game on the land for hunting

> He mentioned Georgia as land people are buying

### 9. 🧐 4 LAND BUYING TIPS I KNOW WORK

- `#1` Walk the land - look at it
- `#2` Knock on neighbors doors, introduce yourself, maybe offer a $10 bill - ask them what they know - realtors don't care about your needs as much as you do, they care about their commission and moving onto the next listing
- `#3` The land itself: make sure you have mineral rights - make sure it is not in a flood plane - no issues with the land
- `#4` Don't offer close to what they are asking for it - "_This is my first offer, come back with a counter offer_" - business is business - list off the problems

### 10. 😇 Buying RAW LAND: Tips & Tricks 😇

Raw Land = no structures

- IMPORTANT: after looking at the land talk to all the neighbors though sometimes it is a risk
- FREE INFO: Go down to the `PVA` office & the `Delinquent Tax Office` & the `Deed Room` which is part of a `Title Search`
  - _Sheriff's ofice_ for something ?!?
- make an offer but before the _closing_ do the _Title search_ - if it comes back clear...
- Deed - looks for changes in the deed -
- Learn how to use a GPS - mark key points in lat/long -
- Ways around a pro survey: coal country has coal company surveys and so are accurate
- TREES: _selective timbering_

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

### 11. 🤩 Raw Land Buying Secrets 😱 Genuinely undeniable

- Land that is _not_ sold instantly is because there is not a professional survey - **but if it is cheap, so what**
- `#1` So no professioanl survey = cheap, **_if it is not cheap don't buy it_** - if the land is dirt cheap is does NOT need to have a pro survey
- `#2` Property tax notice is usually Oct or Nov - **be proactive** - it will go to the prior owner - creeps "buy the bill" >
- `#3` Information is gold - go to the deed ofc, the pvs, sheriffs dept, property taxes, find if there are liens on it, title search ($500), find out where the boundaries are, have pictures, features of the land, etc

### 12. 🤔 Considerations ABOUT LAND 🤔

Kentucky property taxes are extremely cheap

- Raw Land - no structures
- Wood for heat, cooking, furniture
- Property taxes low in rural Kentucky
- Fertile land can be farmed and selectively forested

### 13. 🌎 LAND. Tips On & About 🤔

- `Realtor Tina ...`
- Have a tiny home and charge rent
- Get paid for farmers cutting hay
- Have mineral rights - really bad not to have that
- Check for zoning on what you can build

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

### 14. 😨 HOW TO: HOME & 10 Acres for UNDER $30K. Seriously 🤗

- Amish prefab cabin!!!
- _Spray foam insulation_
- Plywood floor and vinyl flooring on top of that
- _Cistern_, gray water, power hookup for $1000
- What about fresh drinking water
- Need cell service and satellite internet

### 1. 😘 DIY Large SOLAR PANEL STAND 😄👍

- Kickstand for large panels - `320 watt 24 volt Renogy` panel
- Getting 40 `volts` to the `volt meter` in full sun
- Renogy _Lithium Iron Phosphate battery_ - VERY expensive
- Mostly he has _Deep Cycle Lead Acid (flooded) marine batteries_, Nautilus Exide, 115 amp hr, _deep discharge_
- `Adventurer` _charge controller_, 30 amp
- He is using pvc pipe, pvc t-joints, metal hose clamps to attach to the panel
- Everything is glued except where the pipe can hinge
- He is using a "limiter" (rope?) to set the max extension of the pvc legs

> Never hook your charge controller or solar panel without hooking the battery to the charge controller first or it will wrech the controller

### 2. 🥳🌞 200W OFF-GRID Portable Solar SOLUTION 🌺

- People steal solar panels
- 200 watt briefcase, Renogy briefcase ... - mono-crystalline
- 4 panels @ 50 watts each = 200 watts
- Renogy briefcase is nicer than Boulders'
- It's $365 - the latches are horrible but the nicest case in the industry
- He has a `Voyager` charge controller
- Upgrade: the alligator clips that comes with it has a 10 or 15 amp fuse since it is a 200 watt panel
  - People reported of burning their fuses out
  - Have spare fuses - he has them attached with velcro on the back
  - He has 20 or 25 amp fuse
- Think it comes with hook and loop - it gets the cabling out of the way, so it does not get pinched when you close the briefcase
- 200 watt `Goal Zero Nomad` (very fragile) is another portable option
- 100 watt panel is not enough under ideal conditions - 1.5 days to chage the battery with a 12-14 run time
- He also has _golf cart battteries_
- You won't run a fridge off of this - tv, laptop and lights you can, maybe a low energy fridge
- $365 for the solar panel, $20 in cabling, $130/battery ~ $550
  - But you need more than one battery in parallel or in series
- The unit comes with a charge controller - case weighs ~ 35lbs

> He only needs 200 watts for his cabin

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

### 3. 🤩🌞 My portable SOLAR POWER rig I built ☀️

- $8 piece of pine board - sanded the corners, drilled a handle in it
- Attached 2 casters (wheels)
- Also drilled 2 holes for rope to hange it or hang it from the handle
- Rubbed the board with linseed oil, several coats
- Renogy 60 ammp MMPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) charge controller
- 2000 watt pure _sinewave inverter_ (Renogy)
- Power strip attached to the board with velcro
- +/- cables for attaching to the battery
- 20 watt _photo voltaic connectors_ (Renogy)
- $24 total cost
- Golf cart batteries, Interstate 150 amp hr deep discharge - 74 lbs
- He says you don't need fuses (inline) though recommended - not needed for simple off-grid usage

> look for sales on Renogy.com

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

### 4. 🔥🤩 MUST HAVE SOLAR Gadget! Power Queen MICRO controller & New Bluetooth battery ☀️

> He has solar operated security cameras

- 100 watt Power Queen solar panel
- Power Queen 12 volt 100 amp hr battery, bluetooth, $300, 10 year life span, 21 lbs, low temperature cutoff
- Small 20 amp charge controller _prismatic lithium cells_,
- He soldered on the battery cables to the controller wires and also to connectors for the solar panels with Renogy connectors

> you always need charge controllers and maybe inverters

### 5. 🥳 Solar Batteries & POWER Redundancy Solutions. POWER QUEEN🔥🤩

- What to use to connect the charge controller to the _battery bank_
  - Buy jumper cables, split them down the middle, strip off the ends, twist the ends tight and put them in the _controller terminals_
  - That is for the solar panels to converter
  - But for the batteries to the controller, only use pure copper cables
  - 3:38?
  - Battery interconnect cables
- He mentioned Lithium Iron Phosphate batteries (li-fopo's, not lithium iron batteries) - don't have to worry about leaving hooked up to your charge controller & solar panel system and having a fire break out
- Look into mini _Igloo refrigerators_ and _ice making machines_

> Check the dates - he seems to like power queen more than renogy

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

### 6. 🌞🌳 Parallel SOLAR hookup 740Ah & 960W 🤓

> Voltaic.com website > touch led lights, dimmable - low power usage

- 2000 watt Renogy inverter

Parallel battery setup

- Connect positive to positive to positive ...
- Connect negative to negative to negative ...
- The `negative` cable from the power inverter to the `last`/first `negative` of the battery setup
- The `positive` cable from the power inverter to the last/`first` `positive` of the battery setup
- Also positive and negative from the charge controller to the positive/first of the batteries and negative/last of the batteries respectively
  - You need beefy cables from the charge controller
  - Don't use copper clad cca - get solid copper
- You do need beefy solid copper cables from the inverter to the batteries and also for joining the batteries in parallel
- Each battery has a regular screw post and a regular lug which is important because you run out of space for the last/first positive/negative because each of those two has a parallel connection, inverter connection, and a converter connection
- He uses aligator clapms for the controller to the battery connection on the lug nuts
- 740 hrs of lead acid - he has a fridge,
- He has a redundant charge controller and inverter
- He has three 320 watt solar panels on his pvc setup

> $900 for 4 trees to be cut down which was dangerous for the cabin + blocking the sun

> NEVER, EVER HOOK UP SOLAR TO THE CHARGE CONTROLLER FIRST - ALWAYS HOOK UP THE BATTERIES FIRST TO THE CONTROLLER THEN HOOK UP THE SOLAR - and when breaking down disconnect solar panels from controller first - the charge controller has no where to dump the energy to

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

### 7. 🌞🤩 LARGE SOLAR PANEL Mobile Stand DIY 😚

- The stand needs weights for wind
- They should be mounted on the roof but there are disadvantages:
  - Cleaning, access, need 2-3 people to help you mount it, holes in the roof that you need to caulk, ...
- The only negative to mounting on the ground (not in the dirt, elevated) is theft
- Cordage - search on ebay for "cordage" - sold in mm - he has 4mm 1000 lbs
- Need 4 hose clamps - 3/4" PVC, 8 T-Joints, connector add the clamp before it, PVC glue,
- 320 watt solar panel - 400 & 500 watt are too big - $1/watt

### 8. 😍 SOLAR POWER SYSTEM 😘 200W & OKMO power station

- Okmo 1000 watt `power station` - better than Jackery - it has 18 more amp hrs for $250 less than 1000 watt okmo (?)
- Anderson power pull (pole?) y-connector to hook up 2 solar panels
- Ideal conditions - 4 factors: temperature, incidence of the light, intensity of the light, ... couple more that affect recharge time
- Okmo 1000 has a Lithium iron battery - 9-12 hrs for complete recharge
- Don't drain any lithium iron battery to zero - they like to sit around 50-60% - but you want it charged to 100 for an emergency
- Need solar panels, charge controller, power inverter
- The battery is inside the Okmo 1000, but also the charge controller is built in
  - Solar panel to charge controller > battery to power inverter
- This video is confusing

> You always need a charge controller with solar panels
> You basically have 4 things in a solar system setup: 1. solar panels, 2. charge controller, 3. power inverter (preferably pure sinewave), 4. battery

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

### 9. 🌞 DIY SOLAR BRIEFCASE Setup! 😇👍 RENOGY 200W or 100W Solar Briefcase

- 200 watt Renogy Eclipse mono-crystalline solar briefcase:
- Applicable to all solar briefcases:

  - No videos show you how to quicky & accurately hookup your briefcase
  - Make sure you have a 20 watt fuse, not 10
  - Have spare fuses because they are the weak link
  - Have a charge controller
  - Position every thing so things on opposite sides don't pancake preventing the unit from closing
  - Cabling extensions
  - NOTE: he has the charge controller on hooks so he can pull it out to see...
  - Hook the charge controller to the battery first, then to the solar panel, you can burn out your charge controller fast with bright sun
  - Once you are done charging UN-HOOK your solar from the controller
  - Charge controller cables
  - Leads from the solar panels
  - 1st solar panel hooks to the black thing (switch board connector) on the other one then 2nd solar panel to the MC44 connectors
  - Final step hook the MC4 connectors together AFTER the controller-battery connection
  - Lots of velcro - additional cable in case it rains, alligator clip leads
  - You also need a fuse from the controller to the battery, 15 amp fuse
  - _He soldered the cables from the battery into the controller_!?!

  > Renogy Lithium Iron Phosphate battery, $800, less heave than lead-acid

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

### 10. 🥰 Best value COMPACT SOLAR PANEL Briefcase. 100W SOLAR 🥰

- Polycrystalline solar panels, solar panel efficiency,
- Okmo OS 100W monocrystalline - $269
- Anderson power port cabling - needd a Y-cable, he solders his own
- **NOTE**: Decent wattage is 100 watts and above but 200 watts and above for decent recharge times
- ... least amount of incidence relative to the surface of the solar panels

<!-- MC44 connectors -->

### 11. 🏡 🌞DIY OFF-GRID SOLAR PANEL SETUP for CABIN or MOBILE 🌞

- 200 watt Goal Zero Nomad - $650 setup
- He has 2 50 Watt solar panels that fold into a briefcase
- You only need 4 major components
- 1. Your solar panels - he has 100 watt monocrystalline
- 2. You must use deep-cycle lead acid batteries - he has Nautilus Exide marine RV batteries for about $105, 115 mmilli-amps 31 MDC
- 99% of people use deep-cycly marine batteries because Lithium batteries are insanely expensive
- He has 12-volt charger to charge your battery fully beforehand because it will tke 16 hours to fully charge the battery under ideal conditions
- **NOTE**: this unit ships with the solar panels connected to the charge controller but you want to connect to the battery first
- 2 AMP "something" to chage the battery (10:00?) - with a cigarette lighter or an adapter - he has a NOCO 2 amp genius - He also has a 30 amp Dewalt charger which will recharge the battery quicker (where is the setup does that come in?)
- 3. Power inverter, pure sinewave - he has a 1000 watt, it only has a single 3-prong outlet but he uses a 1-3 power strip - hooks up the +/- onto the battery terminals - his was $200
- **NOTE**: everything he is running stuff off of solar charging is watt-hours
- On ebay get 2 sets of alligator clips - he soldered the ends to hook back to the inverter
- He said you don't need a 1000 watt inverter but he recommends that for a minimum - a 1000W requires a 100 watt battery - NOT A STANDARD CAR BATTERY FOR THIS SETUP
- 4 RC4 connectors
- 4. Charge controller - you need to set it - press the button to select the barry type: gel, AGM, flooded, or lithium battery -

Finally:

- Inverter hooked to the battery with alligator clips > plug your appliances into the inverter

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

### 12. 🔥OFF GRID SOLAR setup at my cabin 🌞😎 DIY SOLAR

He is running a mini fridge, minor appliances and recharging devices and batteries

1. 2 150 amp hour lead acid 12-volt batteries connected in parallel (12 volts, 300 amps) - he does not have fuses for the batteries - they are not Lithium batteries - they are deep discharge batteries at $250 per piece - you want 150 amp hour deep discharge 12-volt golf cart batteries - $500 for 300 amp hours
2. 2000 watt power inverter - he has a fuse on the inverter - set the params for the type of batteries you are using, then set how many amp hours,
3. 60 amp MMPT Rover charger - he has a fuse on the on the charge controller
4. 320 watt Renogy solar panel - he has 4 of them - don't get larger than 320 watt solar panels

- For the 2 batteries in parallel, you need 2 sets of jumper cables, they need to be beefy between the battery and inverter - from the inverter to the positive of one battery to the negative of the other
- the alligator clips from the charge controller go to the positive of one battery to the negative of the other battery (same as the inverter)
- You should NOT use alligator clips from the inverter to the batteries OR from battery to battery to connect in parallel (wires get hot, fire hazard), but you can use 12-guage wiring to connect from the charge controller to the batteries because it is not high current UNLESS you have an enormous amount of solar panels
- he mentioned at 6:15 that he is going to ground the inverter (how?)
- the whole setup cost him $1500

> Batteries in parallel: same voltage but higher amperage
> Batteries in series: higher voltage but same amperage
> NEVER buy the flexible solar panels

<div align="right">&#8673; <a href="#back-to-top" title="Table of Contents">Back to Top</a></div>

### 13. 🌞🔥 EMERGENCY SOLAR SETUPS 🤗

- Emergency super simple solar setup - he attached diagrams to this video - he also lists the gear with links - here is the gear:
  - Power Queen 12.8V 300Ah LiFePO4 Battery
  - Power Queen 12.8V 200Ah LiFePO4 Battery
  - Power Queen 12V/24V 30 Amp MPPT Solar Charge Controller

  - RENOGY 40FT SOLAR PANEL TO CHARGE CONTROLLER CABLES
  - RENOGY 200W PORTABLE SOLAR PANEL BRIEFCASE
  - RENOGY 200W RIGID SOLAR PANELS
  - RENOGY 60AMP CHARGE CONTROLLER
- 2-to-1 or 3-to-1 connectors for your solar panels depending on how many you have
- You SHOULD have but you do NOT need to have an inline fuse between your battery and your power inverter
- **_The Setup_**: power inverter to batteries > batteries to charge controller > solar panels to charge controller with Y-connectors in between - and of course cabling
- Most inverters have 2 power sockets - he has a Renogy 2000 Watt which he got on sale for $260 - comes with beefy cables
- You need beefy cables if setting up batteries in parallel or series, actually not as beefy for series
- Keep it simple and have 12-volt batteries
- Battery interconnect cables -
- Check your charge controller limit for amp hours - you may not be able to have many batteries in parallel
- Charge controller - positive to the positive of battery A and the negative to the negative of battery B - same for your inverter to the batteries
- But the first thing is to connect your batteries in parallel then connect the charge controller then the inverter
- You don't need beefy cables from your charge controller to the batteries or from the solar panels to the controller
- He is using battery jumper cables which he split into 2 and cut them in half to get 2 sets
- The charge controller needs to know what it is charrging up so set the battery type and amperage
- He has 40' Renogy cables (recommended length to go from outside to inside) that go from the charge controller to the solar panels
- He has a 100 watt solar panel but he does not recommend buying them but 200 watt is ideal in his opinion
- Renogy 200 watt briefcase solar panels
- 60 amp MMPT REnogy Rover charge controller - can hook up max 800 watts of 12-volt solar to this unit
- rigid solar panels can stay outdoors all t he time but not the briefcase models
- Battery interconnect cables = when connecting multiple batteries together - you can't use jumper cables going from your battery to your inverter
- Another charge controller: Power Queen MPPT 30 amp with a max of 400 watts of solar, half of the Rover 60 Amp - it has Load connections which you do not need to hook anything to that - you can use the REnogy cables but you need to strip them down
- He recommends an inline fuse between the positive of your inverter to your battery

## POWER Videos

Important topics/phrases from POWER videos:

-
- 2000 watt Okmo Solar Generator, Lithium power station, really expensive, $2100
- LiFePo4 Power Queen 12 volt 200 Ah battery
- Lead acid battery off-gas flammable acidic gas

> You don't want to drain lead acid batteries below 50% or they lose their effectiveness - same with Lithium - you can drain them to zero here and don't drain them super low super fast but you can take them way lower than lead acids

### 1. 😘⚡️ Power & Lighting MUST HAVE Favorites 🤩

> The first 3 videos in my playlist were not that good so I deleted the first two and the notes above here are the notes from those 3 videos

- [VOLTAIC Touchlite](https://voltaicsystems.com/usb-touchlight/): $12, 5-pack is $55 - low power usage, large range of power output
- [DeWalt DCL043 Light](https://www.dewalt.com/product/dcl043/20v-max-jobsite-led-spotlight): $71,you need Dewalt battery packs with this
- Power Inverter: 2000 watt Renogy vs Power Queen - Renogy is better
- Charge controllers: Power Queen charge controllers are better than Renogy - you can use a Lithium charger (20 watt) to charge your Lithium batteries when do not want to hook up your solar panels
  - [Power Queen 29.2V 20Amp Lithium LiFePO4 Battery Charger](https://ipowerqueen.com/collections/battery-charger/products/power-queen-29-2v-20amp-lithium-lifepo4-battery-charger)
  - Power Queen 12.8V 200Ah LiFePO4 Battery
  - Power Queen 12.8V 300Ah LiFePO4 Battery
  - Power Queen 12V/24V 30 Amp MPPT Solar Charge Controller
  - Power Queen 100W Portable Solar Panel
- Lithium's do not like fast discharge or deep discharge

> You can't use a 12-volt battery charger on a Lithium battery or you can harm your Lithium battery pack

### 2. 🤯 POWER Independence. 200AH LITHIUM Best Option 🔥

- Lithiums: no fast discharges, no deep discharges!
- Repeat of above: _Power Queen 12.8V 200Ah LiFePO4 Battery_ ($458.99) & _Power Queen 12V/24V 30 Amp MPPT Solar Charge Controller_
- Lithium Iron batteries are not to catch fire or explode but that is not true of Lithium Iron Phospate batteries
