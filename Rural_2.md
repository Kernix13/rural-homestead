### 1. 😃 Help for Dr. Michelle 🤩 CONGRATS on her Kentucky FARM!🤩

- She gave him the location of a piece of land she was looking at so that he could take a look
- "near London, KY" => 24 mins from Manchester => an hour south of him
- it was a 35-acre farm - she is living in an army tent

2. 😱 OMG! EPIC OFF-GRID KY LOG CABIN & BARN & LAND!! 😱

- ~ 14 acres at $138,000 with a large log cabin and a killer barn - it was built for off-grid living - has a creek on the land
- chicken coop inside barn - has an outhouse - sits on concrete
- creosote telephone poles - professionally surveyed

> he says that 4 acres in that location with no structure costs more than this place - HUH?

### 3. `😱 HOW TO: Home & Farm for 30K OR LESS 🥰`

- his friend got 15 acres for $17K
- he mentioned an `Amish built prefab cabins` for under $10K
- $400 for spray foam insulation - lay a sub-floor and vinyl tiling
- SATELLITE INTERNET!
- Niche skill and sell stuff
- Solar panels: 3-4 300 watt 5.5' high x 4' wide is all you need - cheap batteries are lead acid
- drill for a well or bring in your drinking water
- 320 gallon cube unit for $500
- rain water for everything else
- wood burning stove, copper coil around the pipe
- cheap property taxes

> I will need to find the size I need - there may only be bigger plots

> Search `Amish prefab cabin` - 500-$100 to deliver it

### 4. ♦️ RAW LAND TIPS & Expert TRICKS 🤔 - 1 year ago

> TIPS:

- Use Google Earth to zoom around & find different access points
- Check property taxes / tax base -
- Has there been a professional survey done? A survey is worth its weight in gold
  - Check your local PVA office to see what thye say the acreage is b\c it's usually not accurate, off by no more than 5-8%
  - Not professionally surveyed keeps the fools away
- NEIGHBORS: DON'T TALK TO THEM UNTIL YOU OWN THE LAND! They don't know the land behind them is for sale - if they find out, they will buy it - keep that in mind if you are asked what you are doing
- Does it have water - water is very important - sping is the best, next creek
- Trees - are they desirable or small - selective haversting can make the land free
- Always look for land that has been inherited b\c the sellers don't know what's on it
- a fence is gold - it is almost a professional survey
- look to see if it has great access - meaning roads and you can subdivide it and sell parts off
- make some of it a campground kickstarter to make the land pay for itself
- hilly unsurveyed land cab be pure gold - he has land in `Pikeville` which has old growth trees on it
- How good is the internet and cell phone access? that is REALLY important
- How close to the nearest town for food
- Check out the zoning to see what you can and can't do with the land
- look out for pissy neighbors
- Hound realtors to death about picking your land out before it gets listed - once it gets listed, all sorts of people are trying to buy it
  - tell them you aren't going to finance, you have cash - let me know and I will make it worth your while - offer them bonuses for finding you the land
- Don't buy land-locked land, land where you have to go thru someone elses land to get to the land - that is a huge issue - but if you do make sure the easement is written into the deed
- Put on your cabin, put an acre or two around with a road to get to it and that is all you need - raw land takes care of itself
- Make sure it is not in a flood plane
- Are utilities close
- Look into mineral rights - you bought the land but may not own what is below the land - like in Eastern Kentucky, almost no one has mineral rights
- Barns - a bran isn't worth anything unless it is well built and has a concrete foundation - it really doesn't add value
- buy cheap land next to ritzy neighborhoods for an investment
- **Always get a title search**, a title search is insured - they are about $500
  - TITLE SEARCH: _A property title search examines public records to confirm a property's rightful, legal owner_
- buy land that has a farming exemption
- Most important before you buy it - inspect it - walk over all of it
- OFFER CASH - realtors work on numbers per year
- when you buy the land you have to be increadibly proactive on the property taxes the first year b\c the government is really slow - they will send the property txes to the previous owner - the first year you have to be proactive and call the shefiffs dept and tell t hem you are the new owner - find out when they mail t he property taxes - tell tthem to send you the bill - MAKE SURE THEY SEND YOU THE BILL

### 5. 😱 A Most INCREDIBLE LAND deal 😎👍🌳

- his buddy bought 50 acres at $248/acre!
- Pikeville in Pike county

### 6. 😨 A SECRET of BUYING RAW LAND 🤗

- cut/thin the most desirable trees which pays for the land - the land ends up being free - black walnut, oak, hickory, depends on the year

### 7. 😙 Cheap Kentucky Land 🤩

- Locattion: are your neighbors people you wouldn't want to live next to
- is there water, what sort of water
- has the good trees been harvested
- are there structures on it
- are there restrictions on what you can do with the land
- has it been professionally surveyed (never off by more than 8%)
- coal company surveys don't count as "professional" but theirs are pretty close to the actual
- he mentioned Pikeville again

### 8. 🤔 Tricks & Tips: BUYING RAW LAND 🤔

What to look for when buying land

- is it bottom land - is it in a flood zone
- Do you have the correct ground strata for a septic system
- is their water on it or running thru it - is it clean water
- is their an easement - is the easement written into the deed
  - `EASEMENT`: a limited right to use the property of another. Common easements include driveways, private roads, and utility rights-of-way for electric, water, or communication lines. Most easements are contained indeeds; some can arise simply due to the passage of time
  - is it land locked -
- YOU NEED TO READ THE DEED
- are there any redeeming features on the land: caves, how deep is the top soil
- you need a title search - lawyers or yourself - are there any liens on the property
- IMPORTANT - now he is saying to talk to the neighbors - you must do it - can be very revealing
- how accessible to services, food, the raod - how far to the gracery store
- the trees: what kind, how big, any indication people are stealing the trees on it
- does the land have any restrictions on it: for building, septic systems, where you can build,
- is there game on the land for hunting

> He mentioned Georgia as land people are buying

### 9. 🧐 4 LAND BUYING TIPS I KNOW WORK

- `#1` walk the land - look at it
- `#2` knock on neighbors doors, introduce yourself, maybe offer a $10 bill - ask them what they know - realtors don't care about you, they car about their commission
- `#3` the land itself: make sure you have mineral rights - make sure it is not in a flood plane - no issues with the land
- `#4` don't offer close to what they are asking for it - "This is my first offer, come back with a counter offer" - business is business - list off the problems

### 10. 😇 Buying RAW LAND: Tips & Tricks 😇

Raw Land = no structures

- IMPORTANT: after looking at the land talk to all the neighbors though sometimes it is a risk
- FREE INFO: Go down to the `PVA` office & the `Delinquent Tax Office` & the `Deed Room` which is part of a `Title Search`
  - Sheriff's ofice for something ?!?
- make an offer but before the closing do the Title search - if it comes back clear...
- Deed - looks for changes in the deed -
- Learn how to use a GPS - mark key points in lat/long -
- ways around a pro survey: coal country has coal company surveys and so is accurate
- TREES: selective timbering

### 11. 🤩 Raw Land Buying Secrets 😱 Genuinely undeniable

- land that is not sold instantly is because there is not a professional survey - **but if it is cheap, so what**
- `#1` So no professioanl survey = cheap, if it is not cheap don't buy it - if the land is dirt cheap is does NOT need to have a pro survey
- `#2` property tax notice, usually Oct or Nov - **be proactive** - it will go to the prior owner - creeps "buy the bill" >
- `#3` information is god - go to the deed ofc, the pvs, sheriffs dept, property taxes, find if there are liens on it, title search ($500), find out where the boundaries are, have pictures, features of the land,

### 12. 🤔 Considerations ABOUT LAND 🤔

Kentucky property taxes are extremely cheap

- Raw Land - no structures -
- wood for heat, cooking, furniture
- property taxes low in rural Kentucky
- fertile land can be farmed and selectively forested

## SOLAR Videos

### 1. 😘 DIY Large SOLAR PANEL STAND 😄👍

- kickstand for large panels - `320 watt 24 volt Renogy` panel
- getting 40 `volts` to the `volt meter` in full sun
- Renogy lithium iron phosphate battery - VERY expensive
- mostly he has deep cycle lead acid (flooded) marine batteries, Nautilus Exide, 115 amp hr, deep discharge
- `Adventurer` charge controller, 30 amp
- he is using pvc pipe, pvc t joints, metal hose clamps to attach to the panel
- everything is glued except where the pipe can hinge
- he is using a "limiter" (rope?) to set the max extension of the pvc legs

> Never hook your charge controller or solar panel without hooking the battery to the charge controller first or it will wrech the controller

### 2. 🥳🌞 200W OFF-GRID Portable Solar SOLUTION 🌺

- people steal solar panels
- 200 watt briefcase, Renogy briefcase ... - mono-crystalline
- 4 panels @ 50 watts each = 200 watts
- Renogy briefcase is nicer than Boulders'
- it's $365 - the latches are horrible but the nicest case in the industry
- he has a `Voyager` charge controller
- Upgrade: the alligator clips that comes with it has a 10 or 15 amp fuse since it is a 200 watt panel
  - people reported of burning their fuses out
  - have spare fuses - he has them attached with velcro on the back
  - he has 20 or 25 amp fuse
- think it comes with hook and loop - it gets the cabling out of the way, so it does not get pinched when you close the briefcase
- 200 watt `goal zero nomad` (very fragile) is another portable option
- 100 watt panel is not enough under ideal conditions - 1.5 days to chage the battery with a 12-14 run time
- he also has golf cart battteries
- you won't run a refrig off of this - tv, laptop and lights
- maybe a low energy fridge
- $365 for the solar panel, $20 in cabling, $130/battery ~ $550
  - but you need more than one battery in parallel or in series
- the unit comes with a charge controller - case weighs ~ 35lbs

> He only needs 200 watts for his cabin

### 3. 🤩🌞 My portable SOLAR POWER rig I built ☀️

- $8 piece of pine board - sanded the corners, drilled a handle in it
- attached 2 casters (wheels)
- also drilled 2 holes for rope to hange it or hang it from the handle
- rubbed the board with linseed oil, several coats
- Renogy 60 ammp MMPT charge controller
- 2000 watt pure sinewave inverter (Renogy)
- power strip attached to the board with velcro
- +/- cables for attaching to the battery
- 20 watt photo voltaic connectors (Renogy)
- $24 total cost
- golf cart batteries, Interstate 150 amp hr deep discharge - 74 lbs
- he says you don't need fuses (inline) though recommended - not needed for simple off-grid usage

> look for sales on Renogy.com

### 4. 🔥🤩 MUST HAVE SOLAR Gadget! Power Queen MICRO controller & New Bluetooth battery ☀️

> he has solar operated security cameras

- 100 watt power queen solar panel
- power queen 12 volt 100 amp hr battery, bluetooth, $300, 10 year life span, 21 lbs, low temperature cutoff
- small 20 amp charge controller prismatic lithium cells,
- he soldered on the battery cables to the controller wires and also to connectors for the solar panels with Renogy connectors

> you always need charge controllers and maybe inverters

### 5. 🥳 Solar Batteries & POWER Redundancy Solutions. POWER QUEEN🔥🤩

- what to use to connect the charge controller to the battery bank
  - buy jumper cables, split them down the middle, strip off the ends, twist the ends tight and put them in the controller terminals
  - that is for the solar panels to converter
  - but for the batteries to the controller, only use pure copper cables
  - 3:38?
  - battery interconnect cables
- he mentioned lithium iron phosphate batteries (li-fopo's, not lithium iron batteries) - don't have to worry about leaving hooked up to your charge controller & solar panel system and having a fire break out
- look into mini igloo refrigerators and ice making machines

> Check the dates - he seems to like power queen more than renogy

### 6. 🌞🌳 Parallel SOLAR hookup 740Ah & 960W 🤓

> voltaic.com website > touch led lights, dimmable - low power usage

- 2000 watt Renogy inverter

Parallel battery setup

- connect positive to positive to positive ...
- connect negative to negative to negative ...
- the `negative` cable from the power inverter to the `last`/first `negative` of the battery setup
- the `positive` cable from the power inverter to the last/`first` `positive` of the battery setup
- also positive and negative from the charge controller to the positive/first of the batteries and negative/last of the batteries respectively
  - you need need beefy cables from the charge controller
  - don't use copper clad cca - get solid copper
- you do need beefy solid copper cables from the inverter to the batteries and also for joining the batteries in parallel
- each battery he has has a regular screw post and a regular lug which is important because you run out of space for the last/first positive/negative because each of those two has a parallel connection, inverter connection, and a converter connection
- he uses aligator clapms for the controller to the battery connection on the lug nuts
- 740 hrs of lead acid - he has a fridge,
- he has a redundant charge controller and inverter
- he has 3 320 watt solar panels on his pvc setup

> $900 for 4 trees to be cut down which was dangerous for the cabin + blocking the sun

> NEVER, EVER HOOK UP SOLAR TO THE CHARGE CONTROLLER FIRST - ALWAYS HOOK UP THE BATTERIES FIRST TO THE CONTROLLER THEN HOOK UP THE SOLAR - and when breaking down disconnect solar panels from controller first

### 7. 🌞🤩 LARGE SOLAR PANEL Mobile Stand DIY 😚

- the stand needs weights for wind
- they should be mounted on the roof but there are disadvantages:
  - cleaning, access, need 2-3 people to help you mount it, holes in the roof that you need to caulk, ...
- the only negative to mounting on the ground (not in the dirt, elevated) is theft
- cordage - search on ebay - sold in mm - he has 4mm 1000 lbs
- need 4 hose clamps - 3/4" PVC, 8 T-Joints, connector add the clamp before it, PVC glue,
- 320 watt solar panel - 400 & 500 watt are too big - $1/watt

### 8. 😍 SOLAR POWER SYSTEM 😘 200W & OKMO power station

- Okmo 1000 watt `power station` - better than Jackery - it has 18 more amp hrs for $250 less than 1000 watt okmo (?)
- anderson power pull (pole?) y-connector to hook up 2 solar panels
- ideal conditions - 4 factors: temperature, incidence of the light, intensity of the light, ... couple more that affect recharge time
- okmo 1000 has a Lithium iron battery - 9-12 hrs for complete recharge
- don't drain any lithium iron battery to zero - they like to sit around 50-60% - but you want it charged to 100 for an emergency
- need solar panels, charge controller, power inverter
- the battery is inside the okmo 1000, but also the charge controller is built in
  - solar panel to charge controller > battery to power inverter
- video is confusing

> you always need a charge controller with solar panels
> you basically have 4 things in a solar system setup: 1. solar panels, 2. charge controller, 3. power inverter (preferably pure sinewave), 4. battery

### 9. 🌞 DIY SOLAR BRIEFCASE Setup! 😇👍 RENOGY 200W or 100W Solar Briefcase

- 200 watt Renogy Eclipse mono-crystalline solar briefcase:
- applicable to all solar briefcases:

  - none viseod show you how to qquicky & accurately hookup your briefcase
  - make sure you have a 20 watt fuse, not 10
  - have spare fuses because they are the weak link
  - have a charge controller
  - position every thing so things on opposite sides don't pancake preventing the unit from closing
  - cabling extensions
  - NOTE: he has the charge controller on hooks so he can pull it out to see...
  - hook the charge controller to the battery first, then to the solar panel, you can burn out your charge controller fast with bright sun
  - one you are done charging UN-HOOK your solar from the controller
  - charge controller cables
  - leads from the solar panels
  - 1st solar panel hooks to the black thing (switch board connector) on the other one then 2nd solar panel to the mc4 connectors
  - final step hook the mc4 connectors together AFTER the controller-battery connection
  - lots of velcro - additional cable in case it rains, alligator clip leads
  - you also need a fuse from the controller to the battery, 15 amp fuse
  - he soldered the cables from the battery into the controller

  > Renogy Lithium Iron Phosphate battery, $800, less heave than lead-acid
