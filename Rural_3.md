### LEGAL AND PAPERWORK

DEED:

- YOU NEED TO READ THE DEED - look for changes in the deed
- Go down to the `PVA` office & the `Delinquent Tax Office` & the `Deed Room` which is part of a `Title Search`
- Go to the deed ofc, the pvs, sheriffs dept, property taxes, find if there are liens on it, title search ($500), find out where the boundaries are, have pictures, features of the land, video, ...
- **Check out the zoning to see what you can and can't do with the land**

TITLE SEARCH:

- ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS GET A TITLE SEARCH ON YOUR LAND BEFORE FINALIZING PAYMENT, THIS USUALLY COSTS $500+
- **Use a title search to see if there are any liens on the property**, a title search is insured

TAXES

- Check property taxes / tax base
- When you buy the land you have to be increadibly proactive on the property taxes the first year - they will send the property taxes to the previous owner, usually Oct or Nov in Kentucky
- YOU MUST MUST CALL THE PVA AND OR SHERRIFS DEPT WHO ISSUES PROPERTY TAXES AND MAKE THEM SEND YOU THE BILL, BECAUSE THEY DON'T CARE AND WILL NOT SEND THE BILL TO YOU UNTIL THE NEXT YEAR
- Property taxes low in rural Kentucky - CHECK FOR YOUR PROPERTY TAXES ON THE LAND
- Buy land with farming exceptions B\C this makes the lands yearly taxes VERY CHEAP
- Check for ZONING on the land

### THE LAND

- Use Google Earth to zoom around & find different access points
- Has there been a professional survey done? A survey is worth its weight in gold. Not professionally surveyed keeps the fools away
- Coal company surveys don't count as "professional" but theirs tend to be very accurate
- <strong><em><ins>No professioanl survey = cheap, if it is not cheap don't buy it</ins></em></strong> - if the land is dirt cheap is does NOT need to have a pro survey
- _My best deals are unsurveyed land_
- Trees - selective haversting can make the land free: black walnut, oak, hickory, etc
- Always look for land that has been inherited b\c the sellers don't know what's on it
- Don't buy land-locked land or make sure there is an easement
- Is their an easement - is the easement written into the deed
- Most important before you buy it - inspect it - walk over all of it
- Make sure it is not in a flood plane
- Does a GOVT. park surround your land? AWESOME, meaning NO neighbors to worry about in the future
- DO MINERAL RIGHTS COME WITH THE LAND?
- ALWAYS ALWAYS LOOK FOR RAW LAND NEXT TO OR VERY CLOSE TO RITZY NEIGHBORHOODS WITH NICE HOMES!

### HOME AND CABIN

- `Amish prefab cabin` - 500-$1000 to deliver it
- Wood burning stove, copper coil around the pipe
- $400 for spray foam insulation
- Plywood floor and vinyl flooring on top of that

### POWER AND WATER AND UTILITIES

- Are utilities close
- Cistern, gray water, power hookup for $1000
- SATELLITE INTERNET!
- Solar panels: 3-4 300 watt 5.5' high x 4' wide is all you need - cheap batteries are lead acid
- Drill for a well or bring in your drinking water
- 240 or 320 gallon cube unit for $500 - paint it black to prevent the sun from hitting it so the water doesn't get fungus/mold in it (or does he mean algae?) - he collects rain water with his
- Rain water for everything else
- Does it have water - water is very important - spring is the best, next creek
- How good is the internet and cell phone access? That is REALLY important
- **Do you have the correct ground strata for a septic system**?

### REALTORS AND CASH BUY

- Hound realtors to death about picking your land out before it gets listed - once it gets listed
  - Tell them you aren't going to finance, you have cash - "_Let me know and I will make it worth your while_" - offer them bonuses for finding you the land
- OFFER CASH - realtors work on numbers per year
- Don't offer close to what they are asking for it - "This is my first offer, come back with a counter offer" - business is business - list off the problems
- Realtors LOVE LOVE LOVE a quick sale, when you say "ALL CASH NO FINANCING"
- **The BEST WAY to get a deal on land is to GET IT BEFORE ITS LISTED**, hound realtors to consider YOU before its listed and make sure THEY KNOW you'll take care of them if they consider you FIRST.
- `ALWAYS ALWAYS be cold hearted on the buy negotiation. Make an offer 15%+ or lower and offer CASH`
- Never ever EVER EVER offer full price on any land, no matter how much you want it. THIS TACTIC WORKS ALMOST ALWAYS WHEN YOU HAVE CASH TO DROP ON THE PURCHASE

### 1. [Buying Undeveloped Land: The Pros And Cons](https://www.rocketmortgage.com/learn/undeveloped-land)

- Undeveloped land, often called raw land, is a vacant area without any public utilities, buildings or even driveways
- Easements: An easement allows another person or organization the right to use the property for a specific purpose.
- You'll want to make sure the property doesn't have any easements and, if it does, that you're okay with the access that's granted and that it won't impede on your plans for the property
- If the property you want is landlocked, you'll need to make sure you have an easement to gain access. If the property already has an easement for this purpose, just make sure you understand your rights fully
- Amount of time and money needed to prepare the land

### 2. [How to buy undeveloped land](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/buyng-undeveloped-land/)

- Zoning laws restrict how you can use different plots within a municipality. If you're hoping to buy a plot and build a home, make sure it's zoned for housing
- Explore government resources. Depending on how you're going to use the land, you might qualify for financing through the USDA's Section 523 and 524 loans, or the SBA's 504 loan. Some of these will finance construction, as well as the land purchase itself
- Unless you want to live totally off-grid, you'll need to work with the local authorities to extend utilities to your property. Talk to the town and figure out how that process works and what you'll have to pay. The same is true for infrastructure like paved roads

### 3. [What Does Undeveloped Land Mean? And How to Find Undeveloped Land for Sale!](https://remarkableland.com/undeveloped-land-for-sale/)

#### Cons of Buying Undeveloped Land

- **Utilities**: You may need to invest significant capital in infrastructure, roads, and utilities
- **Zoning Restrictions**: The local municipality or county may dictate what you can and cannot do with the land without permitting, approvals, and re-zoning.
- **Access**: Some land is difficult to access seasonally or legally inaccessible altogether.
- **Remote**: The land may be located in a remote area with poor or no cellular phone coverage and limited emergency services

#### How to Find Undeveloped Land for Sale

- The marketing of undeveloped land can be fragmented, decentralized, and buried on the internet
- At times, these properties can be much harder to find. The regional MLS's were built principally to sell homes, and there isn't nationwide MLS coverage.
- Not all realtors are members of the MLS either. And some rural areas are still dominated by "old school" brokers and agents who are slower to adapt to changing consumer preferences and modern property marketing techniques.
- A broker's listing website alone doesn't generate traffic and exposure
- Even with Realtor.com and Zillow, the listings are not 100% identical; properties will be marketed on one but not the other.
- This issue is further exacerbated when searching for undeveloped land on other land listing sites. Be prepared to look in multiple places

#### Where to Find Undeveloped Land for Sale

- If there is an MLS alternative when searching for land for sale, it's Costar's trifecta of land listing sites: _LandWatch_, _Lands of America_, and _Land and Farm_.
- You can specifically filter your search by a host of conditions and fields including acreage, price, and location, or even search broadly for "undeveloped land":
  - [Undeveloped land for sale on LandWatch](https://www.landwatch.com/undeveloped-land)
  - [Undeveloped land for sale on Lands of America](https://www.landsofamerica.com/United-States/undeveloped-land/)
  - [Undeveloped land for sale on Land and Farm](https://www.landandfarm.com/search/Undeveloped-Land-for-sale/)
- Despite their latent deficiencies in listing and mapping land, Realtor.com and Zillow are important listing sites to browse for undeveloped land:
  - [Land for sale in Kentucky on Realtor.com](https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Kentucky/type-land)
  - [Land for sale in Kentucky on Zillow.com](https://www.zillow.com/ky/land/)
