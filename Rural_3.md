# Land

## Best of from RURAL_2.md

### LEGAL/PAPERWORK

- YOU NEED TO READ THE DEED - look for changes in the deed
- Go down to the `PVA` office & the `Delinquent Tax Office` & the `Deed Room` which is part of a `Title Search`
- Go to the deed ofc, the pvs, sheriffs dept, property taxes, find if there are liens on it, title search ($500), find out where the boundaries are, have pictures, features of the land,
- Check out the zoning to see what you can and can't do with the land
- ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS GET A TITLE SEARCH ON YOUR LAND BEFORE FINALIZING PAYMENT, THIS USUALLY COSTS $500+
- **Always get a title search**, a title search is insured - they are about $500
  - are there any liens on the property
- Check property taxes / tax base
- When you buy the land you have to be increadibly proactive on the property taxes the first year - they will send the property txes to the previous owner, usually Oct or Nov
- YOU MUST MUST CALL THE PVA AND OR SHERRIFS DEPT WHO ISSUES PROPERTY TAXES AND MAKE THEM SEND YOU THE BILL, BECAUSE THEY DON’T CARE AND WILL NOT SEND THE BILL TO YOU UNTIL THE NEXT YEAR
- Property taxes low in rural Kentucky - CHECK FOR YOUR PROPERTY TAXES ON THE LAND
- Check for ZONING on the land
- Buy land with farming exceptions B\C this makes the lands yearly taxes VERY CHEAP

### THE LAND

- Use Google Earth to zoom around & find different access points
- Has there been a professional survey done? A survey is worth its weight in gold. Not professionally surveyed keeps the fools away
- Coal company surveys don't count as "professional" but theirs are pretty close
- No professioanl survey = cheap, if it is not cheap don't buy it - if the land is dirt cheap is does NOT need to have a pro survey
- My best deals are unsurveyed land
- Trees - selective haversting can make the land free: black walnut, oak, hickory
- Always look for land that has been inherited b\c the sellers don't know what's on it
- Don't buy land-locked land or make sure there is an easement
- Is their an easement - is the easement written into the deed
- Most important before you buy it - inspect it - walk over all of it
- Make sure it is not in a flood plane
- Does a GOVT. park surround your land? AWESOME, meaning NO neighbors to worry about in the future
- DO MINERAL RIGHTS COME WITH THE LAND?
- ALWAYS ALWAYS LOOK FOR RAW LAND NEXT TO OR VERY CLOSE TO RITZY NEIGHBORHOODS WITH NICE HOMES!

### HOME/CABIN

- `Amish prefab cabin` - 500-$100 to deliver it
- wood burning stove, copper coil around the pipe
- $400 for spray foam insulation
- plywood floor and vinyl flooring on top of that

### POWER/WATER/UTILITIES

- Are utilities close
- cistern, gray water, power hookup for $1000
- SATELLITE INTERNET!
- Solar panels: 3-4 300 watt 5.5' high x 4' wide is all you need - cheap batteries are lead acid
- drill for a well or bring in your drinking water
- 320 gallon cube unit for $500
- rain water for everything else
- Does it have water - water is very important - sping is the best, next creek
- How good is the internet and cell phone access? that is REALLY important
- Do you have the correct ground strata for a septic system

### REALTORS/CASH BUY

- Hound realtors to death about picking your land out before it gets listed - once it gets listed
  - tell them you aren't going to finance, you have cash - let me know and I will make it worth your while - offer them bonuses for finding you the land
- OFFER CASH - realtors work on numbers per year
- Don't offer close to what they are asking for it - "This is my first offer, come back with a counter offer" - business is business - list off the problems
- Realtors LOVE LOVE LOVE a quick sale, when you say "ALL CASH NO FINANCING"
- The BEST WAY to get a deal on land is to GET IT BEFORE ITS LISTED, hound realtors to consider YOU before its listed and make sure THEY KNOW you’ll take care of them if they consider you FIRST.
- `ALWAYS ALWAYS be cold hearted on the buy negotiation. Make an offer 15%+ or lower and offer CASH` - Never ever EVER EVER offer full price on any land, no matter how much you want it. THIS TACTIC WORKS ALMOST ALWAYS WHEN YOU HAVE CASH TO DROP ON THE PURCHASE

MISCELLANEOUS:

- How close to the nearest town for food
- Put on your cabin, put an acre or two around with a road to get to it and that is all you need
- Pikeville in Pike county
- Learn how to use a GPS - mark key points in lat/long
- ONLY TALK TO NEIGHBORS AFTER YOU MAKE THE BUY, avoid being seen by neighbors of the land

> `Undeveloped land`, often called `raw land`, is a vacant area without any public utilities, buildings or even driveways
