## Land

> HOW DO I GET A BUYERS AGENT?

MUST-HAVES:

ðŸ“Œ 1-10 acres of raw/undeveloped/vacant land in a rural area in Kentucky
ðŸ“Œ Zoning that allows the placement of a manufactured home/prefab cabin
ðŸ“Œ A flat piece of land close to the road for a prefab cabin, preferably cleared
ðŸ“Œ Access for a flatbed to deliver and place the prefab cabin
ðŸ“Œ Some kind of road to the property that a "normal" car can use
ðŸ“Œ Not in a floodplain

NICE-TO-HAVES:

ðŸ“Œ Prefer not to buy land-locked land unless there is an easement in the deed
ðŸ“Œ Acceptable soil for a septic system if necessary
ðŸ“Œ Underground water that is safe to drink if I need to drill a well
ðŸ“Œ Telephone poles on the road for electricity and internet
ðŸ“Œ "Decent" cell phone and satellite internet if no utility poles
ðŸ“Œ I do not have a specific county other than Jackson, but Eastern KY is preferred over Western (distance to the ocean)
ðŸ“Œ ~~Professional survey, or better, no survey for cheaper land!~~
ðŸ“Œ ~~No "surprises" and friendly neighbors!~~
