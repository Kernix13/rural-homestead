## Campgrounds with cabins to rent in Kentucky

> Campgrounds with cabins in Kentucky

I may need to stay in a cabin while I look because of Luna or find a cat sitter for her. Another option is to buy a camper.

### [Kentucky State Park Campgrounds](https://parks.ky.gov/parks/camping)

1. Lake Cumberland State Resort Park - primitive site (pets): https://parks.ky.gov/explore/lake-cumberland-state-resort-park-7795#lodging-&-camping
2. My Old Kentucky Home State Park - primitive site (pets): https://parks.ky.gov/explore/my-old-kentucky-home-state-park-7821#camping-&-rv

> Next: Natural Bridge State Resort Park - parks.ky sucks because it goes to a different site and searching sucks

### [Camping in Kentucky and Surrounding Areas Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1159070021242952/)

```
<!-- Message for the group: -->

I need some help. I basically need a place to camp with my cat. But there is more to that. Let me give more detail:

  - I want to buy a few acres of undeveloped land in Kentucky.
  - Once I have it I will get the ball rolling for adding a prefab cabin on the land.
  - I most likely will need to be out of my house by August 15th or the end of August at the latest - I'm in Southeast Pennsylvania.
  - So I need to be in KY so that I can drive to raw/undeveloped land and look at it
  - But what do I do with my cat? I would not trust a syl-nylon tent wall to protect her or keep her in if I am gone for hours.
  - So I feel I need to rent a cabin for a month or more or do tent camping but find a local pet service that boards cats. every time I will be gone for half a day or more

I looked into some cabins at campsites and they are $100 or more per night. That's $3000/month and it may take a month.

Are there any cat lovers in this group who have any ideas to solve my dilemma?
