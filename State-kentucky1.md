- I need some help. I basically need a place to camp with my cat. But there is more to that. Let me give more detail:
  - I want to buy a few acres of undeveloped land in Kentucky.
  - Once I have it I will get the ball rolling for adding a prefab cabin on the land.
  - I most likely will need to be out of my house by August 15th or the end of August at the latest - I'm in Southeast Pennsylvania.
  - So I need to be in KY so that I can drive to raw/undeveloped land and look at it
  - But what do I do with my cat? I would not trust a syl-nylon tent wall to protect her or keep her in if I am gone for hours.
  - So I feel I need to rent a cabin for a month or more or do tent camping but find a local pet service that boards cats. every time I will be gone for half a day or more
- I looked into some cabins at campsites and they are $100 or more per night. That's $3000/month and it may take a month.
- Are there any cat lovers in this group who have any ideas to solve my dilemma?
