## Campgrounds with cabins to rent in Kentucky

What do I do with my cat Luna if I do not have land to at least camp on?

- Do I rent cabins or Yurts at campgrounds?
- Do I find someone to board her for a month or more?
- Do I buy a camper and wait for the house to be sold before buying land and then buying the tiny home/cabin?

> Campgrounds with cabins in Kentucky

I may need to stay in a cabin while I look because of Luna or find a cat sitter for her. Another option is to buy a camper.

### [Camping in Kentucky and Surrounding Areas](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1159070021242952/) Facebook group

```
<!-- Message for the group: -->

I need some help. I basically need a place to camp with my cat. But there is more to that. Let me give more detail:

  - I want to buy a few acres of undeveloped land in Kentucky.
  - Once I have it I will get the ball rolling for adding a prefab cabin on the land.
  - I most likely will need to be out of my house by August 15th or the end of August at the latest - I'm in Southeast Pennsylvania.
  - So I need to be in KY so that I can drive to raw/undeveloped land and look at it
  - But what do I do with my cat? I would not trust a syl-nylon tent wall to protect her or keep her in if I am gone for hours.
  - So I feel I need to rent a cabin for a month or more or do tent camping but find a local pet service that boards cats. every time I will be gone for half a day or more

I looked into some cabins at campsites and they are $100 or more per night. That's $3000/month and it may take a month.

Are there any cat lovers in this group who have any ideas to solve my dilemma?

## Moving to Kentucky

> Mercer, Anderson, Franklin, Knox, Bell,

- `Richard Allen Brittain`: cell signal is iffy...had to install a signal booster
- `Debbie Moss`: I am an agent in Ky and have helped numerous people move here. I would be happy to help you
- `Nicole Carlton`: Messaged you! Would love to help. I'm an agent in central Kentucky - have you checked out Central Kentucky areas like Mercer county, Anderson, Franklin - Heart of KY Real Estate is my agency
- "I live in Lawrenceburg (Anderson) co. So I'm very familiar with anderson and surrounding counties"
- `Latasha Friend`: Hey, I work with a program that helps remote workers relocate to EKY! If you do work remotely, PM me. We offer an incentive as well to offset moving costs
- `Tracy Osborne Henson`: We live in rural Knox county (eastern KY) and have Spectrum internet. I work from home and have no issues. We even stream our TV service - We’re between Barbourville and Pineville. I believe Pineville is in Bell County
- `Courtney Nicole Murley`: Would love to help 🫶🏻🏡 Courtney Murley, EXP Realty, 270-363-7216 - `DID NOT MESSAGE`

> - `Anita Jordan`: Hey Jim! There are many agents out there it’s really important to find someone you trust! Here are some of my suggestions when looking.
>
> 1. Look for someone who has been in the industry for a while. Every transaction is different so agents learn as they go. Someone who have been around for a while will know how to handle different situations better.
> 2. Solo agent vs team - A solo agent will be with you every step of the way but with a team you may be brought on by the team leader and then “given” to the newest /least experienced person they have with the support of the team behind them.
> 3. Find someone who has an incredible network of agents and vendors. If you don’t know where you are going to end up for sure, make sure the person you hire is connected with agents in the areas you’re interested in. They then will work as a team to get you where you want to be. Also once you move they can provide you with recommended trusted vendors (plumbers, electricians, moving companies, contractors) that can help you in your transition.
> 4. Find someone who understands investment real estate. This purchase is the largest investment you are going to make, you want to make sure it’s a good one - even if it’s your forever home.
> 5. Always make sure you feel heard by your agent! You want to make sure the person you are working with has YOUR BEST INTEREST in mind, and not their commission!
>    These are just some of my suggestions when looking for a buyers agent.
>    It sounds like you should consider something somewhat close to Interstate 64 or interstate 75 if you want to have access to those areas. I would almost recommend the southern part of KY near Daniel Boone Forest
