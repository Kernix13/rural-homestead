# Notes for North Carolina

## Rural property - notes from Rich

- Where to find rural land for sale

> _You should look around on `Roanoke island` where I'm at. If you go. West of my position to `Columbia`. You get a big piece of land with a house on it, but it's a little out of the way. Where you can look in `Manns Harbor`. That's just a 10 minute drive from where I'm at. I think you would love the island life_.
