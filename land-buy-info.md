> ...learn about zoning, environmental, sewer, and other issues unique to this type of purchase

Before purchasing vacant land, you'll probably want to check into:

- What services will be available to you locally, including government entities
- Whether your plans will be incompatible with other local property uses
- What building permits you'll need, and
- Whether your plans will be limited by environmental concerns such as endangered species.

### What Are the Local Amenities and Government?

- Start by doing some information-gathering on the area where the land is located
  - Is the local government well run, or will it make your life difficult when you need permits or variances
  - What about nearby shops, parks, grocery stores, ...

### How Will Environmental and Zoning Matters Affect Your Building Plans?

- Investigate the immediate vicinity of the vacant land for concerns like landfills, noisy highways, or industrial uses.
- Maps and aerial surveys prepared by FEMA or Google or found on the town clerk's website can be helpful
- you might find that the plot is near conservation land or other protected resources, meaning you'll enjoy green space around you far into the future

### What Building Permit Obligations Will You Face?

You'll want to know whether you or your general contractor will need to obtain permits or approvals other than the building permit itself, most likely for:

- **Sewer service**. Many towns and villages provide sewer service. Ask the town clerk or local board of health. If a connection is available, how expensive will it be? If the property is far from the nearest sewer line, it might be more cost effective to install a private septic system. State and local health codes will likely govern the required soil quality, height of ground water, and distance from lot lines. If the property seller hasn't already pulled a permit for an engineered septic system, make your purchase contingent on having soils testing done and being satisfied with the results.
- **Water**. Public water hookups might also require a permit, as might private wells. Many towns require that private wells—even those on neighboring properties—be located a minimum distance from a private septic system
- **Zoning**. Virtually all towns have zoning bylaws regulating the kinds of uses permitted on vacant land, including how the lot can be developed. If building a home, make sure that your land is zoned residential! Zoning also regulates setbacks from lot lines and similar issues affecting home design, like the maximum length of a driveway
- **Subdivisions**. If the land is within an established subdivision, additional laws and regulations may apply. Speak with the town clerk about whether the subdivision was properly approved and to check that your land is actually on a public road. Check the subdivision plans on file for rules governing detention ponds and use of common rights of way within the subdivision.
- **Regulated water resources**. Building in or near wetlands, rivers and streams, ponds and lakes, and coastlines is governed by a complicated net of overlapping federal, state, and local laws. These can severely restrict the area available for building. If your land might contain protected water resources, have an engineer evaluate it.
- **Hazardous materials**. If, for example, your land is the former site of a large industrial plant, have an engineer perform preliminary research for you.
- **Possible title issues**. If you go ahead and buy, your attorney (or the lender's) will examine the land's ownership history. Even so, you can anticipate title issues by looking at the local paper or talking to neighbors. Are there rights of way or other easements that cross the property? Has the property been foreclosed on? Has the town begun proceedings to collect back taxes? Issues like this can often be resolved before or at the closing, but it can't hurt to know what to anticipate.

### Are There Endangered Animals or Plants on the Land Where You Hope to Build?

Both the federal and states' governments protect a number of endangered species and their habitats. Information [from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service](https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp/report/table/critical-habitat.html) can help you locate federally protected endangered species near you, and explain the kinds of protections that the government will enforce...the U.S. government offers grant or loan programs to finance protection of endangered species and their environments during new construction. Many states protect a longer list of endangered species than the feds. Check your state's maps and lists.

Almost all government agencies enforce their endangered species regulations by granting or denying permits that are specific to proposed construction or other activity. If your land is home to an endangered species, you might need to obtain one or more permits before going forward.

### Should I Hire an Attorney Before Buying the Land or Building?

It's wise to get legal and other professional help with this process. Even after the land sale has gone through, an attorney might be needed, to make sure you don't miss something important regarding:

- **What title issues must be kept in mind during planning and building**? Prior to closing escrow, you should have reviewed the title insurance preliminary report for potential issues impacting your plans. The attorney can help you revisit that report and further evaluate what kind of recorded restrictions affect the lot, such as environmental or historical designations.
- **Whether previous land owners tried to build on the property**. By reviewing your land's files at the local building and planning office, your attorney can find out whether previous owners attempted to build, and if so, why their plans weren't successful. Your attorney might also check with local courts for lawsuits involving the property or its neighbors.

**Location**

Location can be one of the most important factors in considering land value

**Utilities**

Are utilities, septic systems, or any wells available to serve the property? Although the cost of putting in utilities such as electricity varies depending on location, you can bet it's going to be somewhat expensive. So whether or not the property already has these modern-day necessities can affect the value considerably

**Zoning restrictions**

The more freedom a buyer has to develop their land, the greater the potential value. Local governments designate various zones for different uses of land. It's very important to know what the land can be used for. What's the soil like? Is it agricultural land that could be used for farming? Can you use it as hunting land or some type of recreational activity? Are there mineral commodities that can be mined?

**Curb appeal**

What do the neighboring properties look like?

**Comparables**

One of the most frequently used tools in determining the value of real estate is to find the comparables. It’s called the sales comparison approach in the appraisal field. This refers to the land parcels which were sold recently that are similar to your land parcel.

Comps are relatively easy to find when it comes to homes but can be challenging when dealing with land and other property types. LandSearch is an excellent resource to use when researching land comps

**Flood zones**

Whether or not land is situated in a flood zone

**Property access**

Accessibility is a vital element in valuing land. Does the lot have a way to get to it, and how easy is it? Are there any easements associated with the property? Clearing land and having access put in can get expensive

**Availability**

Supply and demand. Land is no different. If there's a large amount of land for sale in the region, it may be worth less than if available land is sparse

**Topography**

Topography is the shape of the land. The terrain of the land can dictate what the land can be used for just like zoning laws and deed restrictions

**Timber or valuable minerals**

Timber is an extremely valuable resource depending on the species, size, quality, growing conditions, and the local market. When valuing land, make sure to find out if it's considered timberland and what type of timber exists on the property. Take an accurate inventory along with finding out what the local market looks like

**Easements**

There are several types of easements that can exist on a property, but to keep it simple, they can grant someone else access through your property to get to theirs, or restrict what you're allowed to do with it

**Soil composition**

The type of soil that's prevalent on a tract of land can be a huge factor in determining what you can use the land for and as a result, affect the value significantly

**Water features**

In an effort to find the land value, pay close attention to whether or not there is a water feature on the property
