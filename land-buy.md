### Research the property

When you find the right plot of land to purchase, do your homework before making an offer. Here are some key issues to investigate:

- Utilities: Are there hook-ups for water, sewer and electricity on the property?
- Road access: Is there access to the property from a public road?
- Zoning and land-use restrictions: Check your local zoning authority’s website or visit the town hall in person to learn about regulations in the area, and any construction plans that could impact your parcel
- Property taxes: Look into the rate of property taxes on the parcel and make sure they’re not so high as to make the purchase economically unfeasible
- Property survey: Be sure you know exactly where the property boundaries are, so that you know where you can build and where you can’t, or the precise perimeter for fencing

### Make your offer

...present the owner with an offer. This written document contains the details of the property, your contact information, the price you’re willing to pay and other terms

You’ll also want to include contingencies in your offer to protect yourself from factors that might make you want to walk away from the deal. Common contingencies with land purchases include environmental tests, septic system permits, land surveys and zoning regulations

There are templates available online of [sample purchase agreements](https://www.cmich.edu/fas/fsr/cps/PropertyAcquisition/Documents/Sample-AgreementToPurchaseRealEstate.pdf), but unless you’re an experienced buyer, you’ll want to get a real estate lawyer or licensed agent to prepare the offer for you.
