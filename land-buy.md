### Research the property

When you find the right plot of land to purchase, do your homework before making an offer. Here are some key issues to investigate:

- Utilities: Are there hook-ups for water, sewer and electricity on the property?
- Road access: Is there access to the property from a public road?
- Zoning and land-use restrictions: Check your local zoning authority’s website or visit the town hall in person to learn about regulations in the area, and any construction plans that could impact your parcel
- Property taxes: Look into the rate of property taxes on the parcel and make sure they’re not so high as to make the purchase economically unfeasible
- Property survey: Be sure you know exactly where the property boundaries are, so that you know where you can build and where you can’t, or the precise perimeter for fencing

### Make your offer

...present the owner with an offer. This written document contains the details of the property, your contact information, the price you’re willing to pay and other terms

You’ll also want to include contingencies in your offer to protect yourself from factors that might make you want to walk away from the deal. Common contingencies with land purchases include environmental tests, septic system permits, land surveys and zoning regulations

There are templates available online of [sample purchase agreements](https://www.cmich.edu/fas/fsr/cps/PropertyAcquisition/Documents/Sample-AgreementToPurchaseRealEstate.pdf), but unless you’re an experienced buyer, you’ll want to get a real estate lawyer or licensed agent to prepare the offer for you.

## ARTICLE: [How to Buy Land: A Step-by-Step Guide](https://www.familyhandyman.com/article/how-to-buy-land/)

...buying land can be an intimidating and overwhelming process.

Some of the best ways to find land for sale include:

1. **Real Estate Websites**: lists all the ones I have but also Trulia.com which had nothing for me in Kentucky

- Some of the largest and most popular specialty databases include LandWatch.com, Land.com, LandSearch.com, LandHub.com, and LandAndFarm.com.
- For MLS listings, the contact will usually be a real estate agent representing the seller (also known as a seller’s agent). Seller’s agents are financially incentivized and ethically obligated to represent the seller’s interest. Consequently, it’s often recommended to hire your own agent (a buyer’s agent) to represent your interest

2. **Real Estate Agents**: agents have access to every listing on the MLS (“on market” properties), along with properties not listed on the MLS (“off market” properties) through their network of industry professionals like land developers and contractors

- While most real-estate agents can facilitate land purchases, the best agents are those who specialize in raw land...working with “…agents with a lengthy history of land sales or experience in soil science, geology or forestry.”
- McGuire also suggests using agents with the Accredited Land Consultant (ALC) designation through the Realtors Land Institute (RLI), if you can find one in your area. These agents are trained to guide you through the necessary due diligence steps and legal procedures pertaining to land purchases.

3. **Local Resources**: Some FSBO properties can be found in classified ads in local newspapers or online directories like Craiglist and Facebook Marketplace...contact land owners directly

- Bond suggests finding land owners’ contact information on the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) map from the County Assessor’s Office website. Bond also advises checking county tax deed auctions, where land is auctioned off at a substantial discount when the owner fails to pay property taxes

### Factors to Consider When Looking for Land

- Water. If a municipal water supply isn’t available on the property, you may have to install a well or other off-grid water system.
- Sewer. If a municipal sewer connection isn’t available, a septic tank will need to be installed before any construction is done.
- Electricity. If one isn’t already there, the local utility company will need to run an electric line to the building site. Another option is to install a solar-generated system.
- Internet service. Investigate whether cellular coverage and an internet connection are available on the property. You may need to switch cellular service providers, or run a fiber-optic internet cable to the building site.
- Road Access: If there is no public or private road going to the property, you may need to create one. This is often costly
- Zoning...

### Submit an Offer

After you find a desirable property, you need to submit a written offer to the seller. If you’re working with a real-estate agent, they will handle drafting and submitting the necessary paperwork, including a Bid Offer form. If you’re not using a real-estate agent, McGuire recommends consulting with a real estate attorney to advise you on establishing contractual terms and drafting the necessary documents.

An agent or attorney can also advise you about the conditions that need to be met (contingencies) before the sale is finalized. A contingency that specifies the time-frame allowed to complete due diligence is often included. A period between 30 and 90 days is common.

### Due Diligence

Performing a comprehensive inspection of a property is necessary for ensuring the land is suitable for your specific needs. Hedge and Bond suggest the following:

- **Request documents from the seller**. You should request documents pertaining to any covenants, conditions and restrictions (CC&Rs) on the property. CC&Rs dictate what you’re allowed to do on the property
- **Run a title search**. A title search will analyze the history of public records — deeds, tax records and other financial transactions. Essentially, a title search verifies that the seller can legally transfer the property to you without any problems. Potential problems a title search can uncover include liens and easements (the right for a third-party to use the land).
- **Check zoning**. A parcel’s zoning designation will dictate what the land can be used for, and the type of structures that can be built. It’s important to check with the local Zoning and Planning Office
- **Perform a soil test**. _If a municipal sewer hookup isn’t available, you will need to perform a percolation test to determine the rate of water drainage through the soil before installing a septic system_.

Since you know what you’ll buy the land for, you can start looking at the market value for that type of land in whatever area of the country makes sense.

To learn more about valuing land, check out our blog on price per acre land valuation. (See end of file)

One way is to look at land for sale in that area and see how sellers are pricing it. Another way is to look at comps, or comparables. This approach is looking at the recent prices people purchased land for, usually on a price per acre basis. There are online resources that can help with this. In many cases, the county’s website in the area you’re searching will have public property comps.

Once you have a general idea of what properties in your area are selling for, you’ll need to make sure you have the money available to buy the land. Although you can’t predict all expenses, you’ll need to think about costs like property taxes, and any expenses associated with what you’ll use the land for such as building a septic system or bringing utilities to the property. Angi estimates the cost to bring utilities to vacant land in 2022 to be between $6,225 and $34,550 with an average of $20,387 depending on factors like location and topography.

### What to look for when buying land

One of the most common mistakes people make when buying vacant land is to enter into the process unprepared. When considering how to buy land, a vital piece of the puzzle is to investigate and research the property. For a land buyer’s checklist, read our article discussing questions to ask when buying land. (See end of file)

There are many issues that are specific to certain types of properties, but here are a few general issues to be aware of and investigate:

- Location| Utilities | Property taxes | Legal access | Topography | Environmental hazards | Adjacent properties | Owner financing | Zoning, covenants, and restrictions | Easements | Liens | Perc testing | Clear boundaries | Land history | Building time | Closing time | Water features | Mineral, water, and timber rights

### Get help from a land expert

Another way to find land is to enlist the help of a real estate agent. Fortunately, there are dedicated land brokers, and even specialists in land types, like agriculture and recreation. There’s a specific accreditation also called an Accredited Land Consultant that represents deep expertise of land.

Not all land for sale is listed online, and there are still even times when <ins>there’s just a sign posted</ins>. Land agents not only have expertise when it comes to land, but also local knowledge of the area they work in. An agent can also help with land price negotiation, paperwork, and other pieces of the land buying process.

### Make an offer on the land

Assuming you can check all the boxes so far, it’s time to make an offer to buy the land. This is normally a document containing information such as the price you're willing to pay and any contingencies like a land survey, environmental test, and more. It’ll also include land purchase terms like who pays closing costs. Hopefully, they’ll accept your offer, but they could come back with a counteroffer.

### Close on the land purchase

Once an offer is accepted and financing is secured, you can close on the land purchase. Closing is just another way of stating the sale is finalized. Once you close, congratulations, you’ve just successfully become a landowner.

What to know when buying land, especially when you’re hoping to build a home on the property.

Key Takeaways:

- When purchasing vacant land, it’s important to hire a real estate agent who has experience negotiating land transactions.
- Most land deals are done in cash, so make sure you’re financially prepared before purchase.
- Consider access to running water, electricity and sewers, and don’t assume you can get the property rezoned.

Here are the do's and don'ts of buying vacant land:

1. Do work with an agent to find the land.

- Working with a real estate agent when you purchase a home helps you navigate the finer details like negotiations, due diligence and closing the deal. But when you’re purchasing land, it's important to hire an agent who has extensive experience negotiating land deals specifically.
- Use an agent who actually has a track record of representing both buyers and sellers for land transactions.
- Don’t rely 100% on your agent – ask questions and do your own homework as well.

2. Do have your finances in order.
3. Do consider the value of homes in the neighborhood.
4. Do take utilities and road access into account.

- It’s easy to take for granted access to running water, electricity and sewers when you’re buying an existing house, but with vacant land these are not always a given.
- Depending on how developed the area is around the land, you want to know if it’s going to cost money for infrastructure to be run to that land or if it’s already serviced.

5. Do consider incentives.
6. Don't expect to get a loan.
7. Don't skip the environmental tests.

- Similar to a home inspection and background research on a house, a plot of land needs to be subjected to tests and checks to ensure you know what you’re buying and that you’ll be able to build on it.
- **Environmental tests check the soil for contamination from previous use. The site of a former gas station or auto body shop is more likely to have contaminated soil, for example, and residential homes can’t be built there**.
- The land's potential for flooding or its poor soil conditions for building are also a concern. These reports should be interpreted by a professional

8. Don't forget the survey.

- You’ll also want to have a surveyor look at your property to identify the boundaries. Especially if the land is in a neighborhood and has been vacant for years, neighbors may have encroached beyond the property lines, intentionally or not.
- It’s best to buy land that already has a completed survey, geology and soils report

9. Don't talk to the neighbors.

- discussing your plans to build on a vacant lot can easily lead to organized opposition
- it’s common for neighbors who are used to having raw land near their homes to get upset when the status quo is about change and seek to keep you from building

10. Don't assume you can have property rezoned.

### Is It Worth It to Buy Vacant Land?

- But before you become a landowner, be sure to thoroughly research the plot of land to ensure the zoning, utility access and building code for the area will allow you to construct the property you want.

## ARTICLE: [A Quick Guide to Buying Land](https://www.zillow.com/learn/how-to-buy-land/)

- Zoning information is critical in determining whether you’ll be allowed to build what you want on the property. Every piece of land is zoned or classified for a specific use
- <strong><em><ins>Beyond your specific piece of land, or "parcel", you’ll also want to consider the immediate area and any plans that could affect the value of the property or your ability to enjoy it</ins></em></strong>
  - You can find that information in the county or city’s “general use” plan.” This spells out plans for the area over the next 5, 10 or 15 years.
  - For example, suppose you want to build a home on a quiet parcel in a rural area. The planning document can tell you whether there are future plans in that area for a landfill, power plant, commercial zone or new road nearby that could influence whether you want to live there
  - Staff at the government agencies responsible for zoning are well-versed in the details of the plans and can answer any questions you have

### Are there deed restrictions on how you can use the land?

A deed is the legal document that transfers ownership of a property. It includes a description of the property, along with any restrictions on what you can build or how you use the land.

Some common deed restrictions imposed by HOAs include:

- limits on vehicles and where they’re parked
- fences
- types of pets
- types of home-based businesses
- the amount of time you’re allowed to live in an RV during the year

### Can you build on the land?

It may seem like an obvious question, but there are numerous additional factors that can foil your plans for building on a piece of land.

#### Is the land prone to hazards or in a flood zone?

Could landslides be a concern? If the area has a flood designation, this could require flood insurance, which can cost hundreds of dollars a year.

#### What is the land’s topography?

Flat parcels are the cheapest to build on. If you have to move a lot of dirt and trees to create a building pad, it’s going to cost more to build. You'll also want to consider whether the land contains wetlands or other environmentally sensitive areas.

#### Is the soil suitable for building?

A simple soil test or geotechnical investigation can determine how much weight the soil can handle. This is critical information that will tell you whether the ground is strong enough to support a foundation. It can be required before you can get a permit to build on the land.

> Are there utilities on the property or will you have to install them?
> Does your parcel have internet access?

### How to buy land

If you’re just exploring ways to buy land and aren’t ready to engage a professional, start by crowdsourcing some information. Seek out online forums for people who have already gone through the process, or talk to a local builder to see what might be involved. And spend some time searching for what’s available in your desired area.

The process of buying land generally mirrors the process of buying a home and is likely to include the following steps:

#### Contact a lender

If you plan to finance the purchase of land, work with a lender to discuss options. This pre-qualifying discussion will help you understand your budget for land. Your lender will walk you through several, possible financing solutions including a land loan, USDA loan, SBA 504 loan (for business use) or a home equity loan.

#### Hire a real estate agent experienced in buying land

The process of buying land usually begins with an experienced agent. Look for a professional who is familiar with the area and who has experience in land sales. Some agents who have taken special training in land sales will advertise themselves as an accredited land consultant. You can start by compare agent reviews on Zillow’s Find an Agent tool.

While it’s possible to do the legwork yourself, a local builder also can help you decide whether a plot is suitable for development and help through the process of developing it.

#### Shop for land

In addition to working with your agent or builder to identify property, expand your search to include local newspapers, online classified advertising, websites that specialize in land and even an in-person search of the area to look for for-sale signs, especially in rural areas.

#### Research the parcel

Consider whether you’ll be able to build the home you want, and whether you can do so within your budget. Some of things to consider include zoning, setbacks, legal access to the land, the availability of utilities, any HOA restrictions and environmental and soil limitations. Reaching out to professionals like lawyers, inspectors, surveyors, and contractors to help navigate all of this information is highly recommended and can make this process a lot easier.

#### Submit a land purchase offer

If you have an agent, you’ll work with them to craft an offer. Some of the contingencies to consider: financing, including a property appraisal, title search to ensure there are no liens or other owners, buildability as determined by soil tests, setbacks and zoning. Be sure the offer gives you enough time to investigate the issues so you don’t get locked into a contract on a piece of land that you can’t build on.

#### Apply for a loan for buying land

If you like the lender you’re working with, formally apply for a loan now that you know the cost of the property. Your lender will verify your income, assets and debts as part of its underwriting or risk assessment process for the loan.

#### Close on your land purchase

Once your financing has been approved, your lender will set a day for closing, which is when the sale is finalized. You should have homeowners insurance in place, even if it’s just liability insurance.

- Many experts recommend paying for it in cash if you can

### What to Do Before You Purchase Land

- If you’ve decided to buy land, keep in mind that it’s not going to be a short-term project
- Some of the costs you’ll have to account for include fees, permits, the cost of purchasing the land you need, the cost of building your house and the cost of making adjustments to the land to have access to running water and other utilities

### How to Buy Land

- ...when actually buying land there are a set number of steps you’ll need to follow. Buying land always entails:
  - Finding land
  - Choosing the right land
  - Making an offer
  - Completing a land purchase agreement

### How to Find Land for Sale

- A real estate agent can be a big help in facilitating your land search. However, you can also do it yourself.
- Checking the classified ads in newspapers, you can often find landowners attempting to sell their land independently
- It’s often possible to buy plots of land that aren’t listed for sale. Even if a plot of land isn’t “on the market,” the owner of the land may still be interested in finding a buyer if the price is right. Keep your ears open for situations like these. You may end up with land you didn’t even know was available

### Choosing the Right Land

- You’ll need to find an area where zoning laws won’t keep you from buying land for the home you want to build
- Zoning rules set restrictions concerning things like the size of buildings and the kinds of residences that can be built
- It’s also a good idea to make sure that the land’s soil doesn’t prevent you from building, digging a well or getting electricity and natural gas. Will the land’s elevation be an obstacle? Are there any liens on the land or environmental problems that need solving?
- While it’s possible to buy a house or a plot of land without the help of a real estate agent or broker, it can help to have someone on your side who specializes in working with vacant lots
- If you’re opposed to using an agent, it’s still smart to find a real estate attorney who can address your legal concerns
- You need to look at how accessible the land is, figure out its dimensions and find out whether anyone already has the right to use the property

### Making an Offer on a Plot of Land

- When you’re ready to purchase a piece of land, you’ll have to make a written offer. You’ll approach the seller with the terms you’re willing to abide by. You should also include all of the details related to the transaction
- After you make your initial offer, don’t forget that you can negotiate the land price down. It’s best to come prepared with research and data, though, to back up whatever price you’re willing to pay. You can even ask the seller to pay some of your closing costs and include contingencies. These include a clause that states you can walk away from the deal if the land fails to pass inspection

### Completing Your Land Purchase Agreement

- To claim a portion of land as your own, you’ll need to officially close on the land purchase. To do so, you’ll have to sign a land purchase agreement. This agreement will specify how much you’re paying for the land and how much money you’re putting down. The seller will have to sign the agreement as well
- The land contract you’ll sign will include everything that you and the seller agree to regarding the land purchase. Other documents you’ll have to review include state-based real estate forms, a closing statement that highlights all of the costs that stem from the sale and a deed that transfers the land’s title from the owner to you

> _Buying a piece of land isn’t simple. It’s important to do your due diligence and check with specialists and experts. This is to ensure you’re complying with local zoning regulations and real estate laws. Complete all of the necessary steps and you can buy the land you need for the home you’ve always wanted_
