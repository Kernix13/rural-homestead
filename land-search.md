- `[county name]` property lookup

### Real Estate Websites & Professionals

MLS, or Multiple Listing Service, has homes that are available for sale or for purchase, and many of these are abandoned properties.

Realtors with whom you keep in contact may also be a viable resource. Having a network of realtors could give you access to information regarding listings they have currently or are coming up; they may not even be on the market yet or know of pre-foreclosures

Networking with real estate brokers or brokerages may also increase awareness regarding vacant homes, as often, multiple realtors exist with each brokerage. Go to the National Association of Realtors at [www.nar.realtor](https://www.nar.realtor/about-nar) to find those professionals.

### Foreclosures, Inspections, & Evictions

Each county has to keep records of current foreclosures, and those are available at your request. For the most part, this can be done digitally, but in areas that are more rural, a face-to-face meeting may be required. For a list of foreclosures across the country, go to [www.hudhomesusa.org/](https://www.hudhomesusa.org/search.html?from=welcome).

- Inspectors can often lend a helping hand. They may be able to provide you with information regarding homes or properties where they have worked
- Developing relationships with **_real estate attorneys_** can be incredibly beneficial in locating vacant properties

### How To Find Out Who Owns A Vacant Lot

Often, local county offices, such as the assessor's or clerk's department, maintain updated land ownership records that can be accessed either in person or sometimes online. Beyond this traditional route, you can also employ skip-tracing, a technique commonly used by investigators to locate a person's whereabouts or obtain contact information.

For those seeking a more streamlined and comprehensive approach, there are paid software platforms available that cater specifically to this need. Tools like [PropStream](https://trial.propstreampro.com/realestateskills/) and [REIPro](https://www.myreipro.com/?fpr=realestateskills) have made a name for themselves in the real estate sector. They provide users with the ability to swiftly uncover the identities of landowners, not just locally, but spanning the entire nation

...securing access might seem challenging, especially for those who don't possess a real estate license, but it's not an insurmountable task.

### What Is The Multiple Listing Service (MLS)?

The MLS in your region is the database of all on-market houses for sale in your local market. The MLS is a private database maintained by real estate professionals to share information and help their clients buy and sell properties.

The MLS provides data such as Property pictures, Real estate listings, Listing agent’s phone number, Bedroom and bathroom count, Square footage of the house, Zoning and lot square footage, Important listing information.

There are hundreds of different types of MLS systems across the nation, because they are region-specific.

### Why Get Access To The MLS Database?

The MLS is the ultimate source of all the on-market property in your region. IT is where other websites pull their information from because it is the source...nothing is going to beat out the actual MLS. It is the most up-to-date resource.

### How Much Does MLS Access Cost?

The cost of getting MLS access is extremely nominal. Other users of the MLS, such as unlicensed MLS assistants and appraisers, normally come with lower costs to access the MLS database. Fees can be as low as $0 to $75 per month. The key here is to work with a licensed agent to obtain this type of access, which we’ll cover in more detail later in this guide.

### How To Get MLS Access With 6 Strategies

1. ~~Get A Real Estate License~~
2. ~~Using a Real Estate Agent’s or Broker’s Personal MLS Login~~
3. Leverage Free Online MLS Listings
4. IDX Websites
5. PropStream
6. ~~Unlicensed Assistant Access~~

### Leverage Free Online MLS Listings

These online databases offer a significant degree of versatility and information:

- [Realtor.com](https://www.realtor.com/): provides the contact numbers for brokers representing listed properties then dive into research
- [Trulia.com](https://www.trulia.com/): searches across diverse listing categories, from foreclosures and reduced-price properties to resale and for sale by owner (FSBO) listings
- [Zillow.com](https://www.zillow.com/): parallels Trulia in functionalities

### IDX Websites

An IDX website is a syndication of the local MLS feed that a real estate agent hosts on their own website. Most real estate broker’s websites can instantly search properties in your area. This is free, quick, and simple.

It stands for _Internet Data Exchange_, which is a system and set of rules that allows real estate agents and brokers to share each other's listings. It's also known as _Broker Reciprocity_.

This is comparable to looking at properties on Zillow or Redfin, without a lot of the user-friendly features... you will not be able to see all of the crucial information.

### PropStream

[PropStream](https://trial.propstreampro.com/realestateskills/) is a real estate software that pulls MLS data from across the nation, as well as data from other records, such as tax, lien, and mortgage information providers.

PropStream offers instant access to the majority of MLS listings in the nation. It's important to note that PropStream doesn’t contain about 5% of the MLS listings in the nation and there’s usually a seven to ten-day delay for new listings to be populated.

## ARTICLE: [What Is a Real Estate Attorney, and Do You Need One?](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/real-estate-attorney)

A real estate attorney's role is to ensure the legal transfer of property from seller to buyer. These attorneys handle tasks like preparing or reviewing documents, ensuring that the title is clear and facilitating the transfer of funds.

A real estate lawyer's exact duties will vary depending on whether you, the seller or the lender hire them, what your state laws require and what's needed for your home purchase to proceed smoothly.

### What does a real estate lawyer do?

Real estate attorneys handle "real property" transactions. Real property is somewhat interchangeable with real estate — land and permanent structures that are fixed in place.

...a real estate lawyer may prepare or review all of the documents related to your home purchase, including the contract, any additional agreements made with the seller, documents from your lender, and title and transfer documents. If you use a real estate attorney, they may also attend the closing, either virtually or in person.

Real estate attorneys sometimes handle additional parts ... like title searches and title insurance, to ensure there are no outstanding claims or liens against the property.

### Should you hire a real estate attorney?

Even if real estate attorneys aren’t required in your state, you may still want to retain one if you're dealing with a trickier type of purchase, like a short sale, or if there's an issue like a neighboring structure crossing over the property line.

In states that require a closing attorney, know that even though you hire and pay for the lawyer, they are considered a neutral party whose interest is simply to complete the transaction.

> _A real estate attorney is representing your interests only if you hire them as your advocate_.

### How much will a real estate attorney cost?

Real estate attorney costs will vary depending on what services you need and how they choose to bill you. The attorney may charge a flat fee that encompasses a specific set of services (like examining the title abstract and providing a title opinion) or an hourly fee.

Real estate attorney fees are generally paid as part of your **_closing costs_**.

> Article referenced in text is linked below - it's about finding sellers

### Land for sale listings

1. **LoopNet**: one of the most extensive and well-recognized commercial real estate listings platforms on the internet, and it is often the first place prospective buyers go when trying to find land or any other commercial asset type for sale. There are currently 5 million monthly LoopNet users searching through the platform’s 500,000 property listings.

### State-specific and for sale listings

One avenue to find land listings only within certain states is to simply Google, "`land for sale + [state]`"

## ARTICLE: [How to Find Land for Sale (On & Off-Market Land)](https://www.simplybuildable.com/knowledge-center/how-to-find-land-for-sale)

If you are looking to build a custom home, finding land to buy is going to be the first step in the process once you’ve determined your vision, budget, and strategy...ensure that the lot is buildable

### How to find land for sale

Finding land to buy is harder than looking at traditional homes, because it’s a much smaller subset of the market.

<strong><em><ins>The most common place to see lots for sale is the multiple listing service (MLS)</ins></em></strong>. Real estate agents use the MLS to post their lots for sale, which creates a database of properties available.

In the past, real estate agents functioned as the gatekeepers for these listings and required you to work through them to see available real estate. With platforms like `Zillow`, `Realtor.com`, `Redfin`, `Trulia`, and others, you can directly access the MLS. However, it can be difficult for inexperienced land buyers to parse out the most important details and information about the listing...we would still advise that you work with experts to find land to purchase. You may have multiple MLS feeds in your area...

Use various sites when searching for land to ensure you don’t miss an opportunity. When searching, you can filter by "Home Type" to remove the existing homes in the market. Choose the "land" option to see only the results of raw land or vacant lots.

> Their "Land Report":

- Zoning | Setbacks & Height Restrictions | Regulations | Maximum Building Coverage | Tax Rate | Driveway | Fire Department Regulations | Drainage Requirements | Stormwater | Geotechnical | Construction Access | Water District & Connection | Electric & Connection | Natural Gas / Propane Availability | Sewer/Septic Availability | Fire District Review | Flood Zone and Impact | Coastal Commission | Environmental Requirements | Cultural Impacts & Limitations | ADU Requirements | Solar Rating | School Districts & Fees | And more...

### How to find off-market land for sale

**_When buying land, you aren’t necessarily limited to what is currently on the market. There are a ton of unlisted and off-market lots out there that are ready for you to purchase if you know the right way to go about it._**

1. **Look for expired listings**: Expired listings may be tough to access unless you are a real estate agent. Listings expire due to incorrect pricing, buyers dropping out, or seller dissatisfaction with their agent

2. **Contact vacant lot owners**: Oftentimes, owners of vacant lots are willing to sell their properties, even if they haven’t officially put them on the market. If you’re going to do this on your own, you can search for the property owners via online tax portals and make public records requests. There are other companies like [Property Shark](https://www.propertyshark.com/mason/) that enable you to get these details, but there is a charge for each request, and the systems are designed for professionals and can be incredibly time-consuming.

3. **Seek out wholesalers**: Take caution as this approach is only for experts. Real estate wholesaling is a business strategy in which a wholesaler enters into a contract on a home before eventually selling the contract to a new buyer. The wholesaler acts as an intermediary, selling the property on behalf of the property owner and keeping a set profit based on the sale. These transactions can be risky in that you may have little to no inspection period. It is essential that you have experts with you. Without the proper support, you could make a costly mistake. There are a few companies out there that specialize in this. You can find wholesalers on Facebook groups around “real estate” and “Real estate investing.” But always remember to proceed with caution.

During economic downturns, off-market deals become much more important and prevalent. Therefore, acquisition teams should focus on identifying motivated sellers off-market instead of sourcing deals the traditional way.

There are a number of commercial owners that are eager or willing to sell; they simply haven’t listed their property or connected with an agent yet.
