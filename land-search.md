### Government sites

Check out [https://www.hud.gov/](https://www.hud.gov/)

Check out the county assessors' office and appraisal district for information about property ownership at a local level. Google search:

- `[county name]` Central Appraisal district
- `[county name]` property tax assessor
- `[county name]` property lookup

### Real Estate Websites & Professionals

MLS, or Multiple Listing Service, has homes that are available for sale or for purchase, and many of these are abandoned properties.

Realtors with whom you keep in contact may also be a viable resource. Having a network of realtors could give you access to information regarding listings they have currently or are coming up; they may not even be on the market yet or know of pre-foreclosures

Networking with real estate brokers or brokerages may also increase awareness regarding vacant homes, as often, multiple realtors exist with each brokerage. Go to the National Association of Realtors at [www.nar.realtor](https://www.nar.realtor/about-nar) to find those professionals

### Foreclosures, Inspections, & Evictions

Each county has to keep records of current foreclosures, and those are available at your request. For the most part, this can be done digitally, but in areas that are more rural, a face-to-face meeting may be required. For a list of foreclosures across the country, go to [www.hudhomesusa.org/](https://www.hudhomesusa.org/search.html?from=welcome).

- Inspectors can often lend a helping hand. They may be able to provide you with information regarding homes or properties where they have worked
- Developing relationships with **_real estate attorneys_** can be incredibly beneficial in locating vacant properties

### How To Find Out Who Owns A Vacant Lot

Often, local county offices, such as the assessor's or clerk's department, maintain updated land ownership records that can be accessed either in person or sometimes online. Beyond this traditional route, you can also employ skip-tracing, a technique commonly used by investigators to locate a person's whereabouts or obtain contact information.

For those seeking a more streamlined and comprehensive approach, there are paid software platforms available that cater specifically to this need. Tools like [PropStream](https://trial.propstreampro.com/realestateskills/) and [REIPro](https://www.myreipro.com/?fpr=realestateskills) have made a name for themselves in the real estate sector. They provide users with the ability to swiftly uncover the identities of landowners, not just locally, but spanning the entire nation
