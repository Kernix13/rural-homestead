## 1. [How Much Does It Cost To Build A Shed](https://www.urban-sheds.com/post/cost-to-build-a-shed)

_Last Updated: Nov 17, 2022_

> Most costs below come from this article but some figures are from the many other articles I read

- A shed costs from $200 to $30,000 to build. The final cost depends on the style, type, and material you want to use. The national average cost to build a shed is around $2,500
- The average storage shed cost per square foot is around $15 to $150. The price of a shed will typically change based on the style, size, labor costs, shed kits purchased, and building materials
- If you want a large shed, say 12 by 16 feet, you will need to budget around $3,000 to $15,000
- When considering the size of the shed, you should pay attention to the height as much as you do to the floor space. Shed prices differ if it has a high or low roof
- Not all prefabricated shed manufacturers make concrete `slab foundations` a must. However, a significant number of large custom sheds will require one. Various municipalities require custom-built sheds and prefab sheds to have a concrete slab foundation. Ensure you are well informed about the rules in your area concerning construction projects. Needing shed foundation work will add to the final cost of your structure, which could range from $4,000 to $12,000
- The importance of getting a fireproof shed. You should know that accidents occur, and there is no harm in being prepared. It is advised that you go for a shed that is fire resistant to protect your furniture and equipment from damage

Other Additional Costs

- `Land Clearing`: Odds are you will need to clear and grade the land before your shed is constructed. While several factors influence the cost, most homeowners should expect to pay between $1 and $10 per square foot
- Plumbing: `Plumbers` typically charge you about $45 to $150 per hour
- Insulation: The cost of insulation greatly depends on the type of shed you have
- Electrical Installation: If you need some wiring done in your shed, you need to call an `electrician`. This will cost around $44 to $100 per hour of work
- Wood costs less than brick and gives you more customization options as you can easily design it as you want - it is a high-maintenance material, as it is prone to moisture, rot, and insect activity. The average wooden shed cost is about $6,000
- If you want an alternative to wood, `vinyl` should be your pick. It is one of those raw materials that are low maintenance. However, it does not have the natural aesthetic of wood. It can replicate the texture of wood and avoids its drawbacks like moisture damage, insects, and rot. The cost to build a vinyl shed is about $2,000

SUMMARY FROM OTHER SECTIONS:

- Cost around $30 - $150 per square foot - Converting your shed could cost you anywhere from $2000 to $30000. But the costs ultimately depend on the quality of raw materials, fixtures, and structures
- **All of these costs (including the cost of the shed) add up to around $20,000 – $27,000**
- Getting your plumbing hooked up costs about $1,500 to $2,000.
- You want to ensure your shed home is insulated - It costs around $3.50 per square footage to have someone spray foam your shed home – around $2.50 per square foot for flooring and ceiling and $2.50 per linear square foot for walls. For a standard shed home size (512 sq ft), that costs around $4,000 to $6,000
- Typically, `flooring` costs $2.00 to $3.50 per square foot
- To finish off your walls with `sheetrock`, you should figure around $1.50 per square foot
