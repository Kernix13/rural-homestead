- The first step in the process would be to find out if you need Home Owner's Association approval to build a shed
- The HOA sets rules and guidelines for the type, size, style, siding and color you can have on a shed.
- It is always best to obtain their approval prior to starting the permit process. <ins>Typically HOA approval is free but the permit process comes with fees</ins>.

### Local Regulations

- <ins>Zoning Laws</ins>: The first step is to check your local zoning laws and regulations. Zoning laws dictate how land in a particular area can be used and may specify the size, location, and appearance of structures like sheds. Every county and town in Central NC is slightly different.
- <ins>Setbacks and Location</ins>: Determine the required setbacks, which are the minimum distances your shed must be from property lines, fences, septic systems, wells and other structures. Different zones may have different setback requirements. Some properties have easements and typically a shed cannot be built in an easement.
- <ins>Size and Height Restrictions</ins>: Find out if there are any limitations on the size and height of sheds allowed in your area. This can vary significantly from one jurisdiction to another. In most of North Carolina a true building permit is only required when a shed has a dimension that exceeds 12ft. These permits are more in line with a zoning permit because structural plans are not required to be submitted but we do have to submit a site plan showing where the proposed shed will be located
- <ins>Design and Appearance</ins>: Some localities have specific rules about the design and appearance of sheds, such as the materials used, color, and roofing type. This is typically required on a property that is in an HOA or a historic district.

### Prepare Your Site Plan

- <strong><ins>In order to obtain a building permit in almost all of North Carolina</ins></strong> a site plan is required. The easiest way to provide a site plan is to have your property surveyed. <ins>Most people have a property survey done when they purchase a home</ins>. We strongly encourage anyone in the process of purchasing a new home to have the property surveyed as part of your closing.

### Structural Plans

- Structural plans are required for sheds that have a dimension that exceeds 12ft.

### Permit Application

- If the area you live in has a permit portal ... apply for the building permit ... and then schedule all inspections through the portal. <strong><ins>Building permits can take anywhere from 7-21 days to be processed</ins></strong>. It just _depends on how you are zoned and how busy the building permit department is_.

### Permit Fees

- A building permit in the Town of Fuquay Varina for a shed is typically only $80 whereas a building permit in the City of Raleigh for a shed is approximately $600. Most areas charge the permit fees when the permit has been approved.

### Permit Approval

- Most permits are no longer printed but are available for viewing in your building departments permit portal. Some areas such as Johnston County and the Town of Fuquay Varina still issue printed permits

### Post-Construction Inspection

- After completing your shed you will need to ensure that the shed is painted. In most areas only a one inspection is needed.

- You need to work with your local and/or county governments as you start your project.
- Since you plan on doing things the legal way, you will need to make sure you are building in accordance with local building codes and zoning regulations in order to obtain the proper permits.
- Both zoning and building codes dictate how tiny homes are built, but they mean different things
- Local building/construction codes dictate how you can build your tiny house, whereas zoning deals with the location of where it will be built

### Zoning Codes

- Zoning deals with the location of <ins>where</ins> you intend to place your building.
- Zoning regulations are based on more local factors and determine the size requirements of your building on what zone it's located in. You will need to call your local zoning or planning department to find that info.
- Cities and towns in North Carolina have been fairly accommodating for people intending to use tiny homes as an Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU). So if you have plans to put your tiny home in your backyard, most areas have specific guidelines in addition to the standard setback and such. For example, some require that the ADU can only be a certain size, based on the size of the primary dwelling.
- If you plan on putting the tiny home on a different parcel of land, or plan on using it as something like an Airbnb or vacation home, <ins>there will be different zoning guidelines</ins>.
- Zoning codes are super specific to each town and city and typically can have different requirements within each city zone. So your first stop would be to contact the Planning & Zoning department of your county. They will direct you to the proper contact.

### Building Codes

- Local building/construction codes dictate how you can build your tiny house.
- This is really no different than building a home. Just on a "tiny" level. And just like home construction, there are different inspections that must be done. Electric must be inspected. That means, <em><ins>don't add insulation that covers the wiring before approval</ins></em>. Plumbing must also be inspected. There are multiple steps to getting your final approved permit.
- This is why many <em><ins>people who don't understand building codes decide it is best to hire a general contractor</ins></em>.
