- **Vinyl Sheds**: Vinyl sheds are resistant to rot, insects, and weather. They are low-maintenance - may need extra insulation. They can also be more expensive than basic wooden or metal options
- **Prefab or Kit Sheds**: designed for easy assembly, making them a popular choice for DIYers. They often come with pre-cut materials and instructions, saving time and effort - Limited customization options compared to building from scratch
- **Tool Sheds or Garden Sheds**: Tool sheds often have a simple design, making them easier to convert. They are readily available and may be more affordable - Limited space and may require more extensive modifications to meet the needs of a tiny house
- **Barn-Style Sheds**: offer a lofted design, providing additional vertical space. This can be advantageous when creating a loft for sleeping or storage - may limit headroom on the lower level
