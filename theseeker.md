## Pages

1. Home Page

- 2 menus, 1st one does not look great and barely has a hover state - both are left-aligned
  - focus state for top menu good but bad contrast ratio, hover state is barely noticeable
  - opposite for botton nav
- Link to the home page is the H1 text - there should be a logo
- 3 links to the magazine in the header section
- Is the marquee necessary?
- the next section looks great
- "Featured story" section - are they actually featured or just defaulting to last 5 posts? And it should be 3 instead of 5 and the post titles need to be kept between 5 and 10 words, SEO title 70 chars or less (meta desc 120-160)
- What is below the Featured story section? There is no heading?
- only posts and post related pages should have a sidebar - can the sidebar be removed for the home page and other pages?
- "You mave have missed" section is identical to "Featured story"
- Footer: the copyright note is too big and too white and it should have a year - the footer should have something else

2. Questions & Answers

- this is a post not a page and it could be labeled as "Q & A"
- is this page necessary? Turn it into an FAQ page? What do people ask you? Can one Question be "How do I advertise in the magazine?"

3. Posts

- It shows 9 posts. You have more than that. Where is the next button?
- You need to optimize the titles so that the majority of the cards have the same height
- Individual posts pages look pretty good
- Do you want to have comments? No one really comments on blod posts anymore unless it is a very popular blog. You have a Facebook page, people could comment there

4. Register & Login

- looks good but the focus state for the input fields should be more noticeable

5. Other pages:

- `/user` - redirects to the home page and there is no link for this page
- `/members` - under construction? No link to it and nothing there
- `/logout` and `/account` - you may need the logout page for functionality but what is account for?
- `/password-reset` - looks good
- `/audio` - only has this shortcode on it: `[player id=’238′]` ???
- `/player1` - what is this for?

QUESTIONS:

1. Do you want to add a link t o the Facebook page somewhere? In the footer would be ideal - any other social media links? Your YouTube?
2. Why do you have a PayPal image in t he sidebar that is not a link to PayPal?
